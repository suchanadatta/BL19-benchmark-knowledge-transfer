This miasma is generated more readily in Autumn than during other seasons of the year ; is more potent at full and new moon than at other periods of lunation; and more active between sunset and ten o'clock, than during the rest of the day. Miasma seems to possess gravity; soldiers that sleep on the ground-floor are more sicldy than those that sleep on the second or third story. European settlers preserve their health in the Sunderbands of the Ganges by living in lofty houses ; and in the forests of Malacca, some wdd tribes actuaUy roost upon lofty trees ; indeed, the distribution of miasma is directed by the same laws that are applicable to smoke or fog. Miasma is liable to be dissipated by heat; a moist atmosphere is more favourable for its action than a dry one, and a person may sleep in a marsh with impunity, if beside a watch fire. Miasma may be conveyed by the wind to a considerable distance, with its properties unimpaired. A ship may anchor, and a regiment may encamp a mile distant to windward of a marshy island without suffering; whereas, if so situated a mile to leeward, both would suffer from fever.

XII informed by my esteemed friend Doctor Strong, who has long made malaria his study, that some European cultivators preserve their health in the Sunderbunds, merely by living in lofty houses ; whereas, if they slept on the lower story they would suffer very severely, or die of fever. Miasma is capable of being dissipated by heat ; a moist atmosphere is more favourable for its action than a dry one ; and a person may sleep in a marsh with comparative impunity if he sleeps beside a watch-fire. Miasma is actuated by the same laws that actuate the atmosphere, and may be conveyed by the wind to a consider able distance with its properties unimpaired. A ship may anchor a mile distant to windward of a marshy island with impunity ; but if she anchors at the same distance to leeward, she will, in all likelihood, be attacked with disease. An army may encamp with impunity on the sea shore of a pestilential island during one mon soon, and while the wind is from the sea ; but if the monsoon change, and the wind from the in terior blow over the camp they are certain of being attacked. Miasma loses its property of producing fever in its progress on the wind, as if it became too much diluted to take effect; and a town may be situated five or six miles to lee ward of a marsh and not be subject to fever ; whereas, if situated within one mile, it may have many.

A belt of high trees intervening between a marsh and a town is known to afford a similar exemption to the inhabitants. Numerous in stances are recorded of towns being suddenly subject to fever after the cutting down of such belts of trees ; and of others being benefitted by having a grove of trees planted between the miasma and them to windward. If I mistake not the Station of Purnea became suddenly unhealthy from the cutting down a cer tain grove of high trees in its neighbourhood. All the types of intermittent fever may be occasioned by the same exposure to miasma. Four persons may be exposed at the same time, one may get a quotidian fever, one a tertian, one a quartan, and one may escape ; and the one may be attacked an hour or two after the expo sure, another a day or two after, and another a week or twro after ; the seeds of fever lying dor mant in the constitution. Such are some of the acknowledged proper ties of malaria. It is a well known truth that marshes are the principal sources of this miasma, and hence its

There are in general good grounds, for the reputed character they bear, and though it be only a popular opinion, it is the safest plan to retain it. The state of sleeping or waking materially affects the liabUity to miasma : a person may pass through an unhealthy country with safety if awake, whereas if asleep he wiU most likely be attacked; as if the vis medicatrix that protected the constitution when awake, went to sleep along with its master, leaving him unprotected. It is also curious that miasma may be effectuaUy shut out by tying up the head in a gauze veil, which acts like the wire-gauze of the safety lamp. Hence an advantage of the native mode of sleeping with the headandbody wrappedup in a cloth, which no doubt saves them from many a fever. A belt of high trees intervening between a marsh and a town, is known to afford a similar exemption to the inhabitants. Numerous instances exist of towns becoming suddenly unhealthy after the cutting down of such high belts of trees, as well as other instances of towns being protected by having a grove of trees planted between them and the marsh. - Miasma seems capable of accumula tion in the soil, and the breaking in of old forest land is generaUy attended with much sickness.

Yet, on the opposite side of the river is the station of Goalpara, perhaps the healthiest in Assam. That all the stations of Assam are as well situated as they might be, I will not affirm ; but I am con vinced that, with a proper attention to the nature of the country, to the reaches of the river, and the prevailing winds, as healthy stations may be selected in Assam as in any part of Bengal proper. I am of opinion that intermittent fever, and far the greater portion of other fevers and other diseases prevalent in Assam, are the conse quence of miasma or malaria, generated in the decomposition of vegetable matter. Indeed, no fact is better ascertained, or receives more gene ral assent than that a certain quality, whether a gas or a vapour, or a film or an impalpable powder is evolved by vegetable matter while exposed to heat and moisture, and undergoing the process of putrefaction, which has the pro perty of engendering fever when brought in contact with the body. This miasma is generated in greater quantity in autumn and spring than during other seasons of the year ; is more potent at full and new moon than at other periods ; and more active between sunset and ten o'clock, than during the rest of the day. Miasma seems to possess gravity, for people that sleep on the ground-floor are more frequently attacked with fever than those who live in the upper stories ; and, as I have been

We have thought it proper to preface the medical opinions and remarks contained in the following pages, by a definition of the cha racter and effects of Marsh-effluvia, in order to facilitate the compre hension of some of the medical expressions which we have been obliged to use, and to give more precision to the whole question un der our consideration. For this purpose we have turned to the two latest, and what medical men look upon as the two most standard works on medicine published in Britain, viz. " The Cyclopedia of Practical Medicine" of Drs Forbes, Conolly, and Tweedie (London, 1834), and the " Dictionary of Practical Medicine" of Dr Copland, now in the course of publication. We extract from them, without any comment, the following definitions, &c. given of the cause of disease which is believed to exist in emanations from marshes, and vegetable and animal putrefaction. " Malaria and Miasma. — The first of these words, and that which is now generally employed to designate a certain effluvium or emana- tion from marshy ground, we have adopted from the Italian (mala aria, bad air). Miasma is a Greek word, signifying originally conta- gion or pollution, but now, with the occasional adjunct, marshy, not unfrequently applied to the same effluvium or emanation. We infer the existence of the matter designated by one or other of these terms, as we do that of contagion from certain effects on the ar.imal econo- my ; and we trace its origin to marshes, from its having been ob- served, for a series of ages, that such effects are produced only in the vicinity of marshes. ...The observation of centuries having ren- dered us well acquainted with (these) certain effects of malaria, we now reason conversely ; and when we perceive the more familiar of them, particularly intermittent and remittent fevers, we infer its existence, and endeavour to discover its sources.. ..We should
000481948	000481948_99	107 CLIMATE the mountains and high table-lands to the south arrest the genial southern breezes. affected by the noxious exhalations of the soil. This is especially the case on the low and humid coasts of tropical countries exposed to the intensest heat of the sun. Here, from the rank and decaying vegetation, and from the stagnant waters of the lagoons, rises the miasma, which fills the air with the seeds of pestilence and death. Such is the case on the equatorial shores of Africa, and on those of Guiana, whose climates are so fatal to the European races. At Bagdad and Bushire, the hot winds from the Arabian desert raise the temperature at times to 125° Fah. When the Khamsin from the .Sahara prevails in Egypt, it is like the blast from a furnace. 9. Ocean-Currents.— The effect of these has already been noticed. The mass of warm water borne northward by the Gulf Stream softens the climate of the Atlantic States and that of all Western Europe. The same effect is produced along the eastern coast of Asia, at the Aleutian Isles, and on the shores of North western America. The Antarctic current tempers the hot climes of Peru, and the Arctic stream moderates the burning heat of Central America. The Campagna of Rome, once the garden of Italy, but now deso late and filled with sluggish waters, has become unhealthy from the malaria that infects its atmosphere ; and the inhabitants retreat to the higher ground as the sickly season approaches. When the soil of the primeval forests and of the prairies is first broken up and exposed to the sun, miasma prevails, which produces remittent and intermittent fevers. 10. Nature ofthe Soil.— A sandy and porous soil, which suffers the rain to sink through it, becomes drier and more intensely heated than clayey soils which retain the moisture. A rocky region is also drier than a low, alluvial tract. IsOTHEEMALS. 13. If lines are supposed to be drawn in the Northern and South ern Hemispheres through those places which have the same mean annual temperature, they are called isothermals, — from the Greek words isos, "equal," and thermos, "warm." On account of the great differences in the distribution of the solar heat from the equator to the poles, it might naturally be supposed that the isothermal lines would be nearly coincident with the parallels of latitude ; but this is not the case; for the various modifying influences which have just been discussed produce, by their combined effects, wide departures from the parallels, and the isothermal lines encircle the earth in undulating curves. 11. Cultivation. — The climate of any country may be regarded on the whole as unchangeable, since there is no reason for believing that the general temperature of the earth has suffered any percep tible alteration since the earliest historic era, and the mean tempera ture of a country remains the same. Nevertheless, slight seasonal changes have been made by the labors of man. It has been proved by observations that beneath the shades of forests, twelve inches below the surface of the earth, the temperature is 10° Fah. colder during the summer* than it is at the same depth in the contiguous open plain, while during the winter it is the same in both situations. Humboldt was the first to represent on charts these lines of equal temperature, thus showing at a glance the distribution of heat throughout the world. Such charts are termed isothermal charts. By inspecting the accompanying Meteorological Map, the striking deviation of the isothermals from the parallels of latitude will at once be seen. In countries covered by dense forests the winters are longer and more uniform in temperature than in dry, cultivated regions, and in summer the mean temperature of the latter is higher than that of the former. When the woods are levelled and the surface of the earth exposed to the warmth and light of the sun, the summer becomes longer, and the winter less uniform in temperature. The climate of Western Europe is said to have been thus ameliorated ; though according to Arago the climate of France has not altered since the century before the Christian era. By comparing the times of the ripening of plants and the periods of the vintage and harvest, as described by Roman writers, with the present times of vintage and harvest in the same localities, M. Dureas has arrived at the conclusion that the climate of Italy has not varied since the time of Cato the Censor, 147 years before Christ. It is a fact well deserving of notice that the isothermal curves extend farther to the north on the western coasts of the two great continents than on the eastern. The warm equator, or isothermal of greatest heat, is also found sweeping far to the north of the geographical equator. The causes of these deviations have already been explained. According to Sir David Brewster, the geographical north pole of the earth is not the coldest region in the Northern Hemisphere. The two places of most intense cold are found in about the 80th degree of north latitude, one being in America not far from the meri dian of 100° west longitude, and the other in Siberia in about 95° east longitude. The mean annual temperature of the former is estimated by Dr. Brewster to be 3J° below zer.o, while that of the latter is 1° above zero. The mean annual temperature of the north pole he com putes to be 5° above zero ; but Arago, on the supposition that land extends to the north pole, considers its temperature to be much lower. In reference to New England, Williamson remarks, "When our ancestors came to New England, the seasons and weather were uniform and regular. Autumn began with September, and the winter set in about the end of November, continuing till the end of February, when the spring began, and advanced without sudden fluctuations in temperature. The summer lasted but six weeks, and was in sufferably hot. Now the seasons are totally altered, and the weather is far more changeable: the autumn begins and ends later, and the winter does not set in in its severity before the end of December." When Dr. Kane reached the highest latitude he could attain, during the Arctic summer, he observed continually flocks of sea birds winging their way still farther to the north, — leading him to believe that the temperature was milder in the latitudes beyond him, and that the pole was surrounded by an iceless sea, such as was beheld by his companion Morton. The clearing of forests may be carried too far ; for a country may be so denuded as to suffer from droughts by the drying up of brooks and water-courses. 12.

The Jollof are sooty black, and they reside on the banks of the Senegal, on the borders of the Desert. It is one of the hottest countries in the world, but at the same time, the country is flooded by an overflowing river ; heavy rains also fall, and thus miasma is produced. In this country we have the greatest possible amount of heat allied with conditions of moisture and miasma. I have also seen sooty-black people from the interior of Soudan. These in a similar manner dwelt on the banks of the Niger, in a part of its course where it skirts the Sahara. -The coast people of Gaboon are not so black as the Jollof ; and the Gaboon, though on the Equator, is not so hot as the border of the Desert. But the Mpongwe are much darker than the Fans of the mountains where the atmosphere is cooler still. It would be incorrect to say that heat and moisture produce the blackness of skin ; but I think it may be said that blackness of skin is produced by some causes unknown in countries where heat and moisture are allied. It must always be borne in mind that the African tribes are ever migrating and supplanting one another, and long periods of time are doubtless requisite to affect a change of type. For instance, the Fans are pressing down to the coast, and in fifty years' time a light-coloured people may be found in a region where moisture and heat are combined. But this, at least, may be affirmed, that when the natives of the highlands settle on the coast, they suffer much from the fever, and probably it is owing to miasma that the dark colour is produced. The mortality of inland natives trading on the seaboard is mentioned by Magyar (p. 128), and was recently observed in the case of Ashanti soldiers stationed at Elmina. Even cattle and horses are apt to sicken and die when they are brought down from the interior to the coast. Finally, I must observe that most ethnologists discuss this ques tion as if the original colour of man was white ; but the naked pri meval men were probably dark, for white is a colour injurious to wild 2 limals, and seldom if ever found in the fauna of the forest.

A great amount of attention has been evidently be stowed upon the subject by him, so that now, 20 years after his geological survey, it may be said with truth that he was precise in his professional dealings, and almost exact in his locations and descriptions. The enterprise of the citizens has tended to eclipse the brightest day-dreams of the geologist; but there is yet work to be done before all the magnificent mineral resources of the county yield up their riches. SANITARY. Noxious exhalations which arise from moist, rich, and productive lands are generally termed miasma. The greater the amount of vegetable productions the greater the amount of these exhala tions, so dangerous to the health of the animal system. Moist ure, heat and natural decadence of substances are the primary causes of its generation. Heat alone will not be able to produce it; because, under the intense warmth of the Sahara desert, miasmatical vapor does not exist, nor does it show itself under the intense cold of Northern latitudes. Therefore it is evident that it requires heat, moisture, and decaying vegetable substances to produce it. These are to be easily found in this county. The rich alluvial soil, over which, in the past, the commerce of nations might have been put afloat, together with the gradual and ever progressive growth and decay of its rich vegetation, to which may be added the heat of the summer months and the dampness that waits upon the approach of spring, render the locality peculiarly adapted to the generation of vapors, charged with poisonous particles of matter which are undoubtedly very detrimental to health. From the opinions expressed by a few of the leading medical practitioners, it is evident that Jackson is not subjected to the evils which miasma is calculated to foster. Flow is this? It is because the county is partially drained, and therefore com paratively free from miasmatical producers. It is said with some degree of accuracy that the drainage of marshes expels it; while the process of absorption and evaporation, which results after an inundation, reproduces it where it had previously existed. Now Jackson's marshy days are almost passed, and the "chances of an inundation are of a most limited character, so that on both these points our citizens can rest secure in the certainty that disease will not be fostered by the generation of miasma. However there are other causes at work which may form melancholy substitutes for the ordinary marsh. Cess-pools, badly-kept sleeping rooms, and other such hot-beds of disease are sadly prevalent. This is a matter which should reach the home of every householder in the county, and be studiously inquired into by him; because neglect of sanitary precaution is always certain 'to lead to most deplorable results. It is a matter affecting the interests of the public that all these cess-pools be cleaned out and kept clean, otherwise the pernicious odors arising from them will become

This fly would appear to bo concentrated in the region of the cataracts, and not to exist east of the Bar6ze, as the Chuculumbe people are great breeders of cattle. The valley of the upper Zambesi, full as it is of beauty, fertility and natural wealth, exhales from its bosom, amid the aroma of its delicious flowers, a pestilentious miasma. The Macololos were decimated by fevers, and ere the assegais of King Chipopa freed the country from its last conquerors, the climate had already done half the work of destruction. The Bihenos, who resist the fevers of almost all the African countries they visit, are powerless before the miasma of the Zambesi. In the country bstween the Bihe and the Zambesi, where the caravans linger long in bartering for wax, it is very rare indeed to find any cases of fever among the Biheno natives ; but beyond the great Nhengo plain their graves are strewn abundantly. Verissimo, a native born, with an organisation apparently impervious to miasma — Verissimo, who had never been ill in his life before — could not resist the climate of the Baroze, and we have seen him in the preceding chapter prostrate by fever; and I myself, who am pretty well proof against African fevers generally, seemed to be courting destruction in every breath I inhaled in the country. Had this truth been appreciated some time ago, it would have saved the lives of the Elmores, who succumbed through a mere approach to the country ; as the cb'mato in the region of the Quisseque, and from the con fluence of the Cuando to the Linianti, is no better in the way of salubrity than that of the Baroze. I consider I am performing a duty, in thus openly speaking the truth in respect of a country that is exciting the attention of Europe. There it is, and by uttering it I relieve myself of my responsibility, as a conscientious reporter, for any misfortunes which this pestilential region may occasion to those who shut their ears to the evidence of facts. Is it then to be inferred that the Lui is a country which should be shunned, and to which no traveller should turn his steps ? By no means ; and I will endeavour, on the contrary, to demonstrate that it is deserving of serious attention, not merely from Europe generally, but more especially from Portugal. Southern Africa between the 12th and 18th parallels has a mean width of 1875 miles, and the partition of the waters towards the two coasts is effected at about one-fifth of that extent from the western coast, inasmuch as it begins near the 18th meridian E. of Greenwich, that is to say, some 375 miles from the west coast. From that point start two rivers, whose waters debouch into the Zambesi, — the Lungo-e-ungo and the Cuando. Before discussing the importance of those two water-ways, let us for a short space consider the giant river itself, the river into which drain the waters of all the African table-land south of the parallel 12 as far as parallel 20, and to the east of the 18th meridian. The Zambesi is, by nature, divided into three great sections that are VOL. IT. I

The "Delta" has an area of 12,300 square miles, and prior to the construction of the "jetties" its annual advance was 300 feet at the Southwest Pass, 260 feet at Pass a l'Outre and 110 feet at the South Pass. (See Delta, in Glossary, and Mississippi, in Derivations.) Height (at various points) above the sea level with respective dis tance from the mouth of the river. (The average rise of tide at its mouth 14 inches, with one tide a day.) The Dismal Swamp is not a vast bog sunk low in the ground into which the drainage of the surrounding country flows. On the contrary it is above the level ground some fifteen or twenty feet as has been demonstrated by actual surveys. Instead of being a recep tacle into which rivers and streams enter and flow, it is in reality an immense reservoir that in its vast sponge-like bulk gathers the waters that fall from the heavens and pours them into the five different rivers whicli flow onward to the sea. Any one would imagine that the "Dismal" was a veritable charnel house that spreads its miasma throughout the country. On the contrary, it is the healthiest place on the American continent. The swamp is formed entirely of green tim ber. There is absolutely no decomposed wood ; one sees trees lying all around in the forests and swamps. The two principal woods that grow in the place, are the juniper and the cypress, which never rot. They fall prone on the ground like other trees, but instead of the wood decomposing it turns into peat, and being indissoluble by air and water remains for ages perfectly sound. There is nothing in the swamp to create miasma; no rising of the tides and decomposition of rank vegetables and no marshes exposed to the burning rays of the sun. In the ante-bellum days all planters were anxious to hire their slaves to shingle makers in the swamp on account of its health. A death from miasma was never known, or a solitary instance of ague or fever. The air is pure and sweet and the water tinged to a faint wine hue by the juniper, the waters being often used by naval vessels going on long foreign cruises on account of healthful properties, also because it keeps fresh and clear for years, being a strong invigorating tonic with a very pleasant taste. feet 0. 2.9 15.2 33.9 66.0 221.0 310.0 miles feet 322.0 408.0 416.0 505.0 670.0 1290.0 1680.0 miles 1097 1270 1286 1596 1944 2284 2616 Gulf . . . .

Cape Lahou may be considered as the western extremity of civilization on this part of tbe coast of Africa, for the Gold Coast may be here said to commence. —Captain 3Iidgley. CLIMATE, &c— The extreme unbealthiness of Western Africa to the European con stitution arises from its moist and hot atmosphere, impregnated, as it commonly is, with the miasma or malaria of the marshes ; but prejudicial as it is to the European, the natives seem to enjoy good health, and to live to a tolerably old age. The wet season, however, like the winter of Europe, produces inflammatory attacks of the lungs and pleura, with catarrh, or colds, he. ; and the Africans seem peculiarly sensible of the least change in the temperature of the atmosphere.* From some recent experiments on the waters of the rivers and coasts, the details of which are given in the Nautical 3Iagazine for 1841, page 20, it is shown that this un bealthiness may arise from the extraordinary presence of sulphuretted hydrogen gas in these waters. In one instance it amounted to nearly as much as that contained in tlie well known springs at Harrowgate, in Yorkshire, which owe their properties to the same cause. It is difficult to account for this important fact, but the deadly effects of tbe cli mate of this part of the world are very easily resemble to such a cause. It has been experimentally found that so small a mixture as a fifteen-hundredth part of sulphuretted hydrogen in the atmosphere acts as a direct poison upon small animals; and the sensations of languor and nausea described are exactly those which have been experienced by per sons who have been exposed to its deleterious influence in small quantities. The peculiar unhealthiness of mangrove swamps in all parts of the world probably arises from that tree requiring salt water for its growth, and its decaying foliage being thus brought into immediate contact with the sulphates. The hypothesis also agrees with the fact, which has been established, that the unhealthiness of such situations does not extend to any considerable distance from the sea. What is known of the action of vegetable matter upon the sulphates, and tlie immense quantities of vegetable matters which must be brought by the rivers within the influence of the saline matters of the sea, renders this origin of the sulphuretted hydrogen extremely probable. The only other source from whence it could be derived would be volcanic action. " When this matter was first brought under my consideration," continues Professor Daniell, " I was surprised that the nauseous smell which must be necessarily evolved from water impregnated with this gas, at so high a temperature as that of the equinoctial regions, had not been noticed. I have in consequence turned to some of the accounts of the late travels in Africa, to seek for evidence upon the subject ; and iu the Narrative of an Expedition into the Interior of Africa, by the River Niger, by Macgregor Laird and R. A. B. Oldsield, I found the following important observations: — " The principal predisposing causes of the awful mortality were, in my opinion, the sudden change from the open sea to a narrow and winding river, the want of the sea breeze, and the prevalence of the deadly miasma, to which we were nightly exposed from the surrounding swamps. The horrid sickening stench of this miasma must be expe rienced to be conceived : no description of it can convey to the mind the wretched sensa tion that is felt for some time before and after daybreak. In those accursed swamps, one is oppressed not only bodily but mentally with au indescribable feeling of heaviness, languor, nausea, and disgust, which requires a considerable effort to shake off." Another remarkable action of the water is the injurious effect it has upon the copper sheathing of vessels; and as the same agent will produce this result, nothing is wanting to identify this rapid decay of the ships' copper with that of the mortality of the climate. Although these views are questioned by some, still there is great probability of their being correct, and it is a subject well worthy of future inquiry .f The narratives of the ill-fated Niger expedition, as well as of every other traveller who visits those regions, will place the mariner on his guard as to the best means of counter acting the deadly effects of the climate. In the Appendix will be found some medical hints for the preservation of health, which are recommended to attention. * Adams's Sketches, page 69. t See also Nautical Magazine, Nov., 1841, pp. 737-8, and Parliamentary Report.

Their diet consisted of the navy allowance, coffee being substituted for cocoa every alternate day, and fresh meat when it was to be had ; their allowance of spirits was one glass of rum per day; those who preferred it had brandy in its place ; no palm-wine or other intoxicating liquor of the natives was allowed to be brought on board, and little if any was smuggled ; in addition, they had a cup of strong coffee served out to them at day break. A few of them were on shore for a few hours at Eboe, in charge of the mate ; and, with that exception, they were altogether on board their vessel. Secondly. — The principal predisposing causes were, in my opinion, the sudden change from the open sea to a narrow and winding river, the want of the sea-breeze, and the prevalence of the deadly miasma to which we were nightly exposed from the surrounding swamps. The horrid sick ening stench of this miasma must be experienced to be conceived : no description of it can con vey to the mind the wretched sensation that is felt for some time before and after daybreak.

From thence we descended into a plain ; and, last of all, bivouacked for a day or two among the reeds and sedges, which grow to a height of at least thirteen feet, near the Kouban ; but never shall I forget what I suffered here from musquitoes. The hardy Circassian was not much better off; and the only chance we had to escape from their incessant persecution, was by lighting large fires during the day, and creep ing into sacks by night ; and if to this we add the howling of dogs, wolves, and jackals, the bellowing of herds, the chirping of myriads of reptiles and insects of every species, which kept up a constant clamour by day and night, together with the momentary expectation of a visit from the Cossacks, you may suppose my situ ation was any thing but enviable : to say nothing of the badness of the air, the sultriness of the weather, and the possibility of inhaling, at every breath, a poisonous miasma that might destroy life itself. The latter evil is, indeed, the greatest danger that besets the path of the traveller, whose curiosity and enterprise prompt him to explore those countries ofthe East, subjected to pestilential miasma.

It is ascertained that aU the types of intermittent fever may be oc casioned by the same exposure to miasma ; four persons may pass through a jungle at the same time : one may get a quotidien fever ; one a tertian, and one a quartan, and one may escape ; and the one may be attacked an hour or two after the exposure ; another a day or two ; another a week or two, the seeds of fever lying dormant in the constitution. 12. MARSHES.— These are the principal sources of miasma or malaria, and hence the name of marsh — fever ; and hence the propriety of drain ing marshy ground, and the impropriety of excess of irrigation, converting good soil into a nursery for fever. That Calcutta is so much more healthy now than it was in the olden time, when the survivors held a jubUee when the sickly season was over, is chiefly owing to the drainage of its marshes and j eels, and clearing away jungle ; and that cultivated lands may be depopulated even by marine inundation, was manifested in the awful mortaUty from fever that followed the irruption of the sea into the districts of Balasore, and the

Near the mouth of the river, the accumula tions of mud and sand brought down by it are, of course, the most recent — a vast work-shop of nature, where dry land is being formed by the mighty river, for the future abode of man. Low-lying, marshy districts are there, of great extent, caded the Sunderbunds, and covered with a dense tropical jungle, in which death lurks, in many shapes, waiting for his prey. The vast tropical plants, with their rank odour and noisome exhalations, but decay to form manure for others, equally rank, equally noi some, equally huge and thick. To penetrate some of these recesses — to make one's way through the dense aquatic plants and creepers, over the marshy land — woidd be certain death, from the foul gases generated by the decaying vegetables. Miasma lurks under every creeper, and broods in every bush — miasma of the most fatal character. These Sunderbunds have a melancholy in terest of their own, as the birth-place of cholera. Amidst their slimy soil and rank jungle that fatal scourge was born, which has swept, like a

To these causes, which are those which likewise produce the common catarrhal ophthal mia, he adds, miasma and contagion as productive of the Egyptian affection. We have already remarked elsewhere, npon the probability of this miasma arising from the noxious exhalations that take place on the faU of the Nde, and at the season of the Khumaseen winds. With respect to the contagion, he does not consider it at all necessary for the matter to be apphed to the eye, but thinks that it is volatile, i. e., that the discharge, especially when it becomes fœtid, gives off its infect ing particles that first affect the tarsal margin of the lids, and produce this already-described morbid growth from the conjunctiva. Dr. Jager has several times pointed out this early granular appearance to us, and the remarkable round distinct form that these bodies subsequently present in the after-stages of the disease. But we must confess, that although we have had op portunities of examining many hundreds of Egyptians so affected, both at Alexandria and in the hospitals at Cairo, it did not seem to us that these Papil lark'orper were at aU necessary to constitute true Egyp tian ophthalmia ; or that the subsequent granulations differed in any way from those that result from other * The Austrian soldiery are particularly liable to the Egyptian ophthalmia on the first use of the newly-made country wines. This was also the opinion of Beer.

The Professor, it appears, has shewn that sulphuretted hydrogen, in combination with the sea and river waters, is the cause of this phenomenon ; and it is more than likely that it is the miasma thus produced which occasions the destruction of so much human life in that part of the world ; as this miasma prevails not only upon the Niger, but also upon many of the other rivers of Africa. The breathing even of diluted sulphuretted hydrogen is known to be most injurious to the lungs ; but, if inhaled in a pure state, it causes instant death. Would it not therefore be well to inquire, if the Waters of many parts of Ceylon may not likewise contain, though in a much less degree than those of Africa, this destructive gas ; as it has been found that the neighbourhood of lakes, ponds, and rivers, even though not covered with jungle, often affords indications that malaria exists in the immediate vicinity. Would it not be desirable, therefore, that the medical officers in Ceylon should pay particular attention to this circumstance. Let any one only look at a Ceylon fresh-water fisherman, (an exact likeness of one of them, by a native artist, is given here), and say, if there must not be some un known malignant agent at work, which can render him, and nearly all his caste, equally diminutive, and so often sickly and squalid-looking ; and may not sulphuretted hydrogen, combined with the water in which he is constantly wading, be this injurious

Care in the choice of an abode, in cutting dow-n the jungle, in picking out a resting-place when camp ing out, are all conducive to the health. For when the trees are cut down the miasma that rises from the ground has nothing to absorb it ; hence the advice not to clear away the jungle without leaving the brushwood. When camping out, the writer has seen in the morning the value of his mosquito curtain, which has not only kept at bay the virulent httle insects, but has acted as a purifier of the atmosphere he breathed, the outside being covered with the miasma-impregnated moisture that had arisen during the night. It is very curious how the sicknesses of these eastern countries come about, but they may often be traced to the exhalations consequent upon animal or vegetable decay-. For instance, in a coral island, the side whereon the wind blows may be perfectly healthy until the change of the monsoon, when an epidemic may ensue ; and this be entirely due to the fact that wdiere the coral is laid bare by the receding tide, and ex posed to the sun, it decays and produces noxious ex halations.

The plain, though perfectly flat and of soft dry ground, is yet not quite the place for a canter in the dark : it is laid out in rice and corn fields, each divided by a wide ditch or streamlet of water. It is fresh, green, and pleasant, but of very bad cha racter from miasma ; and we were much cautioned to stop nowhere but at a Turkish viUage a httle way up the entirely barren arid slope of one of the boundary hdls, caUed Turkopaxo. Here they said there was no miasma, and certainly the women and children looked healthy enough, and pretty too. They had probably never seen lady-traveUers before, and their curiosity was highly excited. We had sent on our cook (who rejoiced in the extraordinary name of Oua) very early in the morning to have breakfast ready for us, and on arriving at the rillage we found he had requested a holiday for the school-chddren, taken possession

We thought it the best meat we had ever eaten, and our servants seemed always contented. After the troops left, the meat became horrible. Eut I think that the Forty-Second never received better rations than during the time they were here, although some variety in the cooking would have been an improvement. In regard to fever, the best authorities state that it is the result of miasma from the marshy soil and ravines, technically called " malaria." But here in Kyrenia there is no marshy soil; the ground seems quite free from all miasma of any kind. We were certainly told that the rain came down in tropical showers, but up to the present date I have only seen one day of hard rain during the eight months spent in the island. • It is true that the inhabitants say that last year was an unusually dry one, and especially bad for fever, but I cannot see how this explains the doctors' theory. I only know of one thing to support it ; and that is, that although so many little torrents flow from the hills all winter, turning many hundreds of mills in their course, as they approach the sea they gradually disappear in the earth. One never sees an outflow of water into the sea. On the contrary, where, under ordi nary circumstances, the stream's outlet would be, there is invariably a bank of raised earth or stones. Farther inland, but within a certain distance of the shore, the streams always seem gradually to slacken in force, and the water gradually to disappear, percolating, I suppose, as best it can through the soil to the sea.
001889463	001889463_306	Our. XXXVI. OF THE PEOPLE. 303 " This," say the Metropolitan Sanitary Commissioners, " there is reason tn believe, is an under estimate. The cesspool, however, in general forms but one-fourth of the eva piu*,*! ting surface: the house-drain forms half or two fourths, and the sewer one ; but, connected as the sewers and house-drains mutually are, and acted upon by Un winds and barometric conditions, the miasma from the BD drains and sewers of one district may be carried up to another. We cannot be absolutely certain that part of the stench experienced in the Dean's Yard may not have been due to the contents of the sewers from the drains of the House of Commons, or at some time from Duck-lane or Pye-street ; and, according to the evidence of Mr. Batterbury, who met a strong current of air coming t'nun the extended cesspools near the school, the miasma from that place would have been carried through the common sewers, and from them into the streets and houses of other neighbourhoods." One cannot contradict a specific official statement of this kind, ami affirm that it is not so : but I shall venture to say. with all due deference, that I, for one, cannot believe it. Nay, there is official evidence to prove that it is at least an exaggeration, for in the Ninth Annual Re- port of the Registrar-General, dated August 1, 1848, the state of the great metropolitan parish of Marylebone, in respect to this very matter, is specially alluded to. After stating that the parish contained in 1841 the va.t number of 14,169 inhabited houses, and 138,164 inhabitants, and that the annual value of the property rated for the relief of the poor was 815,279£, the Registrar adds, "Yet a considerable part of the parish is without sewers, or any direct open communications with the sewers. It is said, though the information on this head is imperfect, that half the houses in the parish have cesspools, many of

The Garrows, one of the hill tribes of Assam, are the most powerful, athletic race of men I have seen in India ; yet they inhabit a country, into the in terior of which no European could penetrate without the certainty of a most dangerous fever. In some parts of South America when a slave makes his escape from bondage, he finds a safe asylum in some noted malarial jungle ; well knowing that his master would follow him thither at the risk of his life, and would rather lose his slave than attempt to pursue him. Land-holders frequently take advantage of their being seasoned to some marshy situation ; by renting their farms at a very low rate, when a succession of casualties to strangers has prevented people in general from having any thing to do with such unlucky spots. In most cantonments in India there are certain marked houses known from their unheal thiness, and these are generally waste, or only occupied for a month or so by strangers. There are generally some good grounds for the re puted character they bear ; and though it be a popular opinion, it is perhaps the safest plan to entertain it. The state of sleeping or waking materially affects the disposition to miasma. A person may be exposed when awake to miasma and not suffer, but is much more predisposed to an attack if he is exposed to it asleep ; as if the guardian that protected the constitution while awake, went to sleep along with its mas ter, leaving him unprotected. Hence the dan ger of sleeping in a marsh. Nevertheless a

And the Isthmus traveller, as his eye wanders over the primeval forest, the impenetrable jungle, the slimy bottomless morass ; as his burning cheek and aching bones warn him of the deadly miasmas arising from them, cannot but concede that Mr. John L. Stephens must have been urged by inspiration when he eloquently pleaded with capitalists for the support they so generously lent him, in carry ing out bis daring conception. I leave the task of enumerating the almost insurmountable difficulties which were overcome iu the accomplishment of this enterprise to a more eloquent pen than I possess ; indeed, words can give no just conception of obstacles which presented themselves on every hand. A climate as deadly as any that ex ists on earth, fatal to the white man even when using the utmost precaution ; how almost impossible, then, for the unac climated engineers to prosecute their labors, exposed by clay to the fierce heat of a vertical sun ; wading breast deep in a jun gle emitting deadly and overpowering miasmas, and resting by night on the damp, slimy earth, exposed to the seething eva porations, every particle of which atmosphere is a compound of poisonous gases. Under these destructive influences the arm of labor was rendered powerless almost as soon as it reached the scene of action, and cargo after cargo of brawny Irishmen suc cumbed to the stealthy advances of the destroyer, who fixed upon them his murderous embraces simultaneously with their disembarkation. Still the work did not flag, fresh importations supplied the places of those who had been victimized, and every pile which supports those miles of tressel-work through those dread morasses, points in solemn silence to a victim of the irfe sistibility of human enterprise.

The bye-streets were often impassable for filth, and to within the last few years it was impossible for women to pass along some of the streets connecting the Corso with the Babuino, so continually were they used by men for that convenience the houses did not afford. In the courtyards of nine-tenths of the houses there were open wells sunk to a con siderable depth, the sides of whicli were green with damp. These also created miasma and unhealthi ness during the hotter months; and in the grounds of the many private villas within tho walls, built by wealthy persons, but occupied by their impover ished descendants, were stagnant pools of water — where once there had been gushing fountains — covered with rotting verdure and spreading malaria all around. Up to a very recent period it was the custom to flood the immense Piazza Navona — then a vegetable market — with water every Sunday during the month of August. It was made a kind of popular festa ; those who kept, or could afford to hire carriages, used to drive backwards and for wards through the water, stirring up the refuse of decayed vegetables below, while the poorer sat around in crowds enjoying the fun. When the sluices were opened, some of the accumulated refuse of the week was carried off. The remainder, soaked with water, lay and rotted in the sweltering

To guard against this sickness — as they did not buy salted cattle — they were recom mended never to permit their horses to bite grass or drink water until the morning mists, haze, or miasma, wdth which the low grounds are frequently covered, should have been first entirely dissipated, leaving the veld dry. The horses consequently should be fed at night, and only allowed to graze at wdll during the later and warmer parts of each day. This will be best effected by the English sportsman bringing proper nose-bags and head-stalls with him, by the use of which, with great care and attention, I have seen delicate and valuable animals preserved, where there were no stables, during very bad seasons. It is the general opinion that the poison causing the fever is to be found in the dew. It is certain that horses eating dew-wet grasses dur ing the sickly season almost invariably die. This is so firmly believed that I have known both Dutch men and Englishmen to wash carefully every blade of grass or sheaf of oats coming from the damp air be fore it was admitted into their stables ; and I must certainly say that this safeguard has been followed by good results. That there is something in the dew and miasma theory can be readily gathered from this fact : " im ported horses," when properly stabled, and not allowed out except during the later and warmer hours of the day, seem very frequently to escape the disease alto gether; but to an imported animal so kept, one single night's absence from shelter during the unhealthy time will always prove fatal. So much for unsalted horses.

It is also clear that the decay of such resinous vegetable matter is so partial, gradual, and peculiar, that no unwholesome miasma is ever thrown out by it, and fogs and chills from evaporation are almost entirely prevented. Not only is this the case, but it is now considered by the best medical authorities that the balmy incense-like odour, the resinous perfume in fact, which pervades the ah- in and around these woods is a most important agent in the ame lioration of disorders and the soothing and strengthening of convalescents ; and we know some of the most eminent medical practitioners in London who send their patients hither to obtain the advantage of this circumstance alone. We can at least say that we never experienced more agreeable sensations from the character of an atmosphere itself than that of the Bournemouth woods has always excited in rambling through them. With regard to its marine aspect, it is equally peculiar and advantageous — most other watering-places are either on too exposed portions of the coast, or else in close re-entering arms of the sea, and frequently affected by the miasma from adjoining mudlands or bogs. Bournemouth is not open to either of these objections — situated in the great bay between the projections of the Isles of Wight and Purbeek, it has all their shelter, with perfect openness to the British Channel ; and as no estuary is nearer than four or five miles, and the

To the scrofulous, the climate of Upper Sydenham is peculiarly adapted, aud more particularly so to children. Scarcely a youth of either sex, however strongly may be implanted in them the seeds of the disease, can reside for a few years in this smiling region without receiving per manent benefit ; and many a " Paterfamilias " has had cause to bless the day when he turned his back on the foul and polluted miasma of the leviathan city, to breathe (surrounded with the invigorated treasures of his heart) the pure, the tonic, and the exhilarating atmosphere of Sydenham. In advanced periods of the disease, and in patients who are too prostrated by debility to ascend the breezy hills, and oppose theh muscular energies to the blustering winds which occasionally assail such elevated regions, the temperature of Lower Sydenham may be more desirable. The sheltered nooks and valleys, there so abundantly met with, offer abodes congenial to those with exhausted mus cular power, and whose respiration is impeded, as well as in doubtful and obscure indications. In the latter category, all suspected invalids should undergo a careful and well-conducted physical examination by the stethe scope and pulmometer, aided by the most approved methods of percussion and compression and such adapted modes as the peculiarities of each individual case may seem to demand. In concluding this subject, I would observe that scarcely

Ferns and bright-green mosses form a tangled undergrowth of tropical luxuriance. But these mangrove swamps, beautiful as they appear to us by comparison with the great desert tract of the coast we have so long sailed past, are full of deadly miasma. We wind among the broad stretches of the river, and anchor in the wide reach of water before the quays of Guayaquil. Guayaquil is the chief port of the Republic of Ecuador. It is the great outlet for the trade of the whole province, a trade consisting largely of cocoa exported to France and Spain. Ecuador provides two-thirds of the production of cocoa to the whole world, and 25,000 to 30,000 bags are frequently shipped on a single vessel. The banks are lined with quays, sloping to the water's edge. Two or three unwieldy-looking river steamers lie at anchor. There are also many bathing establishments. Guayaquil, with its red-tiled roofs, standing out from the hills of rich green, its cool promenades of arcades, formed by the overhanging miradores of the houses, its waving groups of cocoa palms, appears a picturesque town. Thirty-five thousand people dwell in the houses concealed behind the quay frontage, but we do not venture to land, and sleep with hermetically closed windows, against the miasma rising from this unhealthy port. Guayaquil is only 4" removed from the equator, and enjoys a reputation for perpetual yellow fever and small-pox.

Ill, After commencing the descent, we had some beautiful views of the Yuan-chiang Plain, the river winding through it, the villages dotted about here and there on the hillsides next the valley. Terrace-cultivation was continued up in an unbroken line to the top of ridges, in some places from 1000 to 1500 feet above the valley. Pine of several sorts was abundant — the biggest only 2 feet in diameter — and there were other trees, but none of large growth. The foliage, however, was thick and beautiful. We were vastly amused, and so were our braves and muleteers, to see the chef — Muff, as he was called — seated on his pony, with sleeve held tight over his nostrils and mouth, followed by the boy with a dirty cloth tied round his head. The cloth, I feel convinced to this day, was the identical one with which our plates, dishes and everything else we possessed were cleaned. If so, I think I was right in assuring him that he ran more risk from the cloth under his nose than from the much dreaded miasma or ch'ang of these regions, for which the mist had been mistaken. The Yuan-chiang valley is noted for miasma, and the muleteers had evidently been " laying it on" with our servants ! The caravan dogs are very clever. They are admirable watch-dogs, allowing no one but their masters and their friends to come near. It is marvellous how soon they recognise tne people who are to be permitted to approach. But we saw nothing of the "fierce Tartar dogs" of the Yiinnanese muleteers I once read an account of. The dogs with us were not Tartar, nor

It is also clear that the decay of such resinous vegetable matter is so partial, gradual, and peculiar, that no unwholesome miasma is ever thrown out by it, and fogs and chills from evaporation are almost entirely prevented. Not only is this the case, but it is now considered by the best medical authorities that the balmy incense-like odour — the resinous perfume, in fact — which pervades the air in and around these woods is a most important agent in the ameli oration of disorder and the soothing and strengthening of convalescents ; and many of the most eminent medical practitioners in London send their patients hither to obtain the advantage of this circumstance alone. With regard to its marine aspect, it is equally peculiar and advantageous — most other watering-places are either on too exposed portions of the coast, or else in close re-entering arms of the sea, and frequently affected by the miasma from adjoining mudlands or bogs. Bournemouth is not open to either of these objections — situated in the great bay between the projections of the Isles of Wight and Purbeck, it has all their shelter, with perfect openness to the British Channel ; and as no estuary is nearer than four or five miles, and the sandy uplands possess great elevation, it is perfectly free from any drawback arising from low lands, tidal muds, or retentive soils. In order to show the value of climate as a remedial agent, reference may here be made to the introduction to the third edition of Sir James Clark's work on climate, where, treating of the selection of a winter residence for invalids, either in the south of Europe or in the southern part of England, as a matter of vital importance, he observes : —
001036234	001036234_29	32 pairing health in a general manner, which I believe to be the mode in which emanations from putrefying animal and vegetable materials, in irrigated lands, act for the most part in this climate. Thus, for example, bread adulterated with ground flint or alum, milk with chalk, wine with logwood and other materials, must be very unwholesome, and cause numerous deviations from health, yet I am not aware that they have caused any perceptible increase of mortality in those dis tricts in which they have been used. " While I hold the emanations in question to be very unwhole some, I must confess that it is my opinion that they have, on some occasions, been blamed for mischief which they never perpetrated ; and that, in short, the injury which they are wont to effect has been greatly exaggerated by some writers on the subject. " Lastly, I hold it to be essential to health that a pure atmosphere be supplied for respiration, as well as wholesome food for digestion ; and that it is the imperative duty of civil rulers, one of the most im portant which thej' owe to the public, to check, by every means in their power, the adulteration of a fluid which is necessary to the ex istence of every human being." The following opinion on the effects of this nuisance on the public health, from Dr Mackenzie, Carlton Terrace, will, from the extent of the writer's professional experience, be regarded with interest. " I think it is impossible but that the effluvia, malaria, or miasma, proceeding from this concentration of all the filth of Edinburgh, must have a deleterious influence on those exposed to it. Forty years pro fessional experience in three quarters of the globe confirm these im pressions. I confess that I am unable to analyse malaria, miasma, or these unhealthy evaporations; but will add, that, however bitterly medical men may differ in technical disquisitions upon this subject, there has been but one opinion among them, and mankind generally, in all ages, as to their deleterious effects." Dr Richard Hvie, George Square, Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, in giving his opinion, expresses himself in the following forcible manner, in a letter addressed to Mr Drysdale. " How any man, and more especially how any medical man, can deny the insalubrity of those artificial marshes, isto me altogether in- comprehensible. If pure air be necessary to the health and comfort of our species, and no axiom is more trite, surely foul air must be in- jurious to both ; and if all of us, from a sense of it* offensive and un- wholesome nature, use every expedient to remove stagnant water from our own immediate neighbourhood, it is a little too much to assert, that the accumulation of that water, and its conversion into vapour, in the vicinage of our city, can be harmless or safe. That which is noxious on a small scale cannot but be mischievous on a Inrge one. 1 1 has been stated, indeed, that if those irrigated lands had been productive of malaria, its injurious effects would have been more ob-

Fifteen or twenty years ago, these diseases, together with those always sure to accompany them, the hepatical diseases, hypo chondriasis and jaundice, held such a formidable sway, tbat they spared but very few, especially of the immigrants. But as the land is becom ing subjected to culture, as forests are cleared, and swamps and marshes dried up, these diseases more and more rarely occur, so that I now only render professional services to one-third of the number of fever patients I formerly had in treatment, some ten or fifteen years ago. Diarrhœa prevails to some extent, but always in a mild form, being very rarely, if ever, dangerous. Infants suffer in great cities, from the "cholera infantum," which disease can nowhere be met with in the country; all those diseases, however, which are caused in all other countries by the rapid change of temperature, occur also here. "Upon comparing tbe state of health of this country with that of Eastern Pennsylvania, of which I was a former resident, I must arrive at the conclusion, that we live in a comparatively very salubrious dis trict." The following is taken from a letter of Dr. J. G. Zeller, M. D., a physician of Springbay, Woodford County. " In summer, miasmatical fevers prevail. Those residing along the ravines of rivers, or in their valleys, are usually visited by them ; some times, also, particularly in a moist spring, the inhabitants of the prai ries suffer from them. In fall and winter, the abdominal typhus fever sometimes occurs; but never the real typhus, properly speaking, as the miasma proceeding from morasses appears to be antagonistic to the typhus miasma.

Take necessary medicine regularly. 4. Begin the day with some refreshment, no matter how light. They were told at the same time, that unless they pur chased what are called "salted" horses — that is, animals which had recovered from the disease known by the very vague and general term of " horse-sickness," but which is really a fever, whose principal symptom seems to be violent pleuritis — they might find themselves at any time deprived, from this cause, of their animals. To guard against this sickness — as they did not buy salted cattle — they were recommended never to permit their horses to bite grass or drink water until the morning mists, haze, or miasma, with which the low grounds are frequently covered, should have been first entirely dissipated, leaving the veld dry. The horses consequently should be fed at night, and only al lowed to graze at will during the later and warmer parts of each day. This will be best effected by the English sportsman bringing proper nose-bags and head-stalls with him, by the use of which, with great care and attention, I have seen delicate and valuable animals preserved, where there were no stables, during very bad seasons. It is the general opinion that the poison causing the fever is to be found in the dew. It is certain that horses eating dew-wet grasses during the sickly season almost invariably die. This is so firmly believed that I have known both Dutchmen and Englishmen to wash carefully every blade of grass or sheaf of oats coming from the damp air before it was admitted into their stables ; and I must certainly say that this safeguard has been followed by good results. That there is something in the dew and miasma theory can be readily gathered from this fact : " imported horses," when properly stabled, and not allowed out except during the later and warmer hours of the day, seem very frequently to escape the disease altogether ; but to an imported animal so kept, one single night's absence from shelter during the unhealthy time will always prove fatal. So much for un salted horses. With regard to the " salted " ones, or those

It does not depend upon the quarter from whence the wind comes, as the wind coming from the same may bring either frost or thaw. Yet this is certain that iis effects upon plants is always the same, it does not act partially, but when two sets of the same plants are growing near each other, both suffer alike and are perhaps cut down in a single night. This is not the case according to the miasma theory, for there, in some instances, one crop is destroyed, and another adjoining one of the same kind is preserved. The order of the universe is so constituted, that it is regulated by fixed laws, and not by those which are variable and uncertain. Dr. Ar naut has explained to us, in a most conclusive manner, the theory of the winds. The heat, on the surface of the globe, caused by reflection, ra rifies the temperature near it, and thus creates a constant succession of currents of air. The evaporation going on from the surface rises into a colder atmosphere', and then, becoming more condensed, it remains there until fresh currents of air cause it to descend again in rain. By the at traction of gravity the atmosphere which surrounds us, is carried along with us in our rotatory motion, and unless this were the case, the im mense rapidity with which we move would bring death and destruction in its train. If our atmosphere is so confined in its space, can it be sup posed that a noxious ingredient should be conveyed to us from a great distance in the movement that is continually going forward from West to East ? Would it not seem more probable that, like the thunder cloud or electricfluid.it should inhabit a particular quarter of the heavens, and not extend beyond it ? But it entirely surpasses all the bounds of credibility to suppose that where atmosphere is so fixed to place, and acted upon by local cierumstances, it should have become tainted, precisely in the same manner and degree in such different quarters of the globe, in America, Denmark, and many other countries besides our own. It is not to be wondered at that the current opinion has run on the side of miasma having been the cause of the disease, when the external appearances of the plant are considered, and when it has even been as serted that these appearances have shown themselves in cases where the root has not been affected at all. If this could be fully proved there would be an end of the question. But although the root may appear to have escaped injury, and may not have arrived at a state of decay, yet it may be possible that the seeds of disease may have been implanted in the tubers, which may have rendered them incapable of bringing their outsets to

The autumn rains commenced in 1873 with a great thunderstorm on the 24th of November ; and now the face of the country sud denly changed, and the cool, clear, delightful autumn weather set in — most treacherous of all the seasons in Palestine, as the sun then draws out the reeking miasma from the softened ground. The plains became green with tender grass, the great cloud-banks rose behind the hills, and I awoke one morning to hear, to my dismay, the croaking of frogs close to the camp. AVith the expe rience of one more year, we should at once have moved to higher ground. AVe stayed however where we were, and suffered in consequence. The climate of Jericho must have altered greatly since Josephus described the place as "a region fit for gods." Thrice we visited the Jordan Valley ; three times the terrible remittent fever of Jericho threatened valuable lives in our party, and once it proved fatal. The change of climate is due, I imagine, to the decay of cultivation. Herod planted palm-groves, and watered them by aqueducts still remaining. The groves existed in the seventh, and even in the twelfth century ; but now only two trees can be found. The Crusaders also undertook cultivation, and made sugar at the ruined mills under Quarantania, still called the " sugar mills." At the present day the land is quite as productive as ever ; but the Arabs disdain agriculture, and the inhabitants of Eriha are so enervated, by the climate, that they bring men down from the hills to reap their scanty crops. Every kind of vegetable will grow here — tomatoes, vegetable, marrows, grapes and indigo-; yet the beautiful streams of Kelt and of Elisha's Fountain ('Ain es Sultan) are allowed to run to waste, or to form malarious pools, and thus the untilled lands in the plain reek with miasma.

This unhealthiness arises from the moisture and heat of the atmosphere, which is commonly impregnated with the miasma or malaria of the marshes, producing those indescribable feelings of heaviness, langour, nausea, and disgust, which require a considerable effort to shake off. But however prejudicial to the European, the natives seem to enjoy good health, and to live to a tolerably old age. The seasons* may be divided into two — the wet and dry ; the former of which is the most unhealthy for white residents and voyagers. The African climate derives its peculiar constitution from excessive atmospheric humidity, conjoined with a high temperature, and the constant exhalation of local miasmas, more or less influenced in their noxious prevalence and origin by various electrical laws, at present but very partially known. The wet season, like the winter of Europe, produces inflammatory attacks of the lungs and pleura, with catarrh, or colds, &c. In the alluvial and swampy districts of Western Africa, and even in the more elevated table lands, the maladies from which Europeans suffer are those generated by malaria, an endemic or epidemic poison, resulting from a combination of different local influences. In many instances, when concentrated, they induce that morbid condition of the body which ends life ; and as the diseases, therefore, proceeding from these causes are not unfrequently developed in an aggravated form, and a low, insidious type, an energetic mode of treatment at once becomes requisite. The necessity for unacclimated persons adopting such measures as might enable them to withstand the attacks of the local affections, and modify their severity, is too obviously enforced to require comment. There can be little doubt that by a judicious code of sanitary regulations, a tolerable state of health may be maintained in several of these pestilential localities for a considerable period ; but at the same time it must be distinctly understood, that though such regulations may prove unable to avert sickness, they will go far towards restrict ing its violence, and when the ordinary febrile and dysenteric diseases are some what divested of their more formidable symptoms, they will have lost much of that intractable character, so difficult of management, and consequently will be rendered more amenable to the remedial effects of medicine. These climatorial influences do and must necessarily greatly interfere with and retard the development of commerce, and the civilization of the natives, notwithstanding the stimulus offered by regions unsurpassed in their fertility and productiveness. Dr. William F. Daniell, a gentleman who served 17 years in most of the countries of Western Africa, has much assisted these agencies by giving the following rules for the preservation and maintenance of good health by those engaged therein : — * Baron B-oussin says, "the division of the two is connected with the periods when the sun crosses from one hemisphere to the other, and is modified as that luminary advances to, or recedes from the Equator."

Anchorage. — The best anchorage is in 12 fathoms, mud, about 3 cables from the shore at the head of the bay. W^OOd may be procured by cutting it. Danger. — In entering port Gallipoli from the eastward, care should be taken to avoid a reef which lies 3J cables off shore, and bears N.E. § N. distant 5^ cables from the north-east extremity of Bekchi islet. The reef, about 2 cables in length east and west, has only 4 feet water on it, and 3 and 4 fathoms round it. It can bo seen by keeping a good look-out. GIOVA BAY and PORT.— Between port Gallipoli and the base of the high mountains on the north, Giova bay resembles a broad canal, being only 2\ miles wide, decreasing to 14 miles at the port or anchorage of Giova, 5 miles eastward. With the exception of the reef just mentioned, and the shoal ground bordering the low shore at the head of the bay, there are no daugers. As the water shoals gradually, a vessel may anchor in any convenient depth by the lead; the holding ground at port Giova is most tenacious.* Miasma. — The river Kadin rises a short distance within the head of the bay and inside the bar is 3 fathoms deep ; it receives several strong .salt springs in its passage to the sea, and these mixing with the fresh water cause such a rank and unwholesome vegetation round the small swampy island in the entrance, that the miasma arising from it proves fatal to the inhabitants of the small village in its neighbourhood, who are obliged in consequence to abandon their habitations for a certain time every year. Ancient buildings. — Several remains of ancient buildings indicate this part of the gulf of Kos to have been the site of a town (perhaps ancient Baryassa), and some fortifications, and a paved road leading to Marmarice and crossing the river Giova by an ancient bridge, leads to the supposition that it was a town of some consequence. The idea is strengthened by several tombs having beeu found cut in the cliff about 2 miles eastward of port Giova ; they are somewhat in the style of those at Petra, and evince considerable skill, as well as opulence on the part of 4*he proprietors. The tombs are of the mixed Egyptian and Greek orders, the doors and entrances having the inclined sides ; the largest is completely isolated, and cut out of the living rock, and so perfect as to be easily delineated. Some way below the present bridge, (an ancient one), is another, overthrown as by an earthquake ; it appears to have been an ancient and admirably constructed work. * See chart No. 1,604.

Climate. — The Western coast of Africa, especially the intertropical portion, is considered extremely unhealthy to those natives of more temperate regions who may be compelled to visit or reside there. This unhealthiness arises from the moisture and heat of the atmosphere, which is commonly impregnated with the miasma or malaria of the marshes, producing those indescribable feelings of heaviness, langour, nausea, and disgust, which require a considerable effort to shake off.

One tornado, that occurred at night, began at East and drew roand to South ; and we have had them from the westward also. When the sea breeze is strongest, the tornadoes are found to be most violent. There are likewise hard squalls from the S.E., which have not the characters of the tornado, the black arch and vivid lightning gathering to leeward, but are not the less dangerous."

" From the experience Dr. Roch had in medical charge of the ' Golden Fleece,' he submitted the following outline of what he considered a Model Hospital Ship : — " The class of vessel best adapted for this purpose would appear to be an iron ship, " not less than 10 feet between decks (i.e. between the upper and main deck), lined with " wood on the outside down to the watermark, with a non-conductor of felt between the " wood and iron, pierced along the sides with large square ports, 3 feet by 3 feet. Two " large central ports on each side, flush with the deck, and sufficiently large (8 feet by " 8 feet) to admit readily a wounded man on a hospital stretcher or dhooly, when raised " out of a sick boat by a tackle. These ports should he furnished with gangways and " ladders for the accommodation of the sick. Model Hos pital Ship. Ports. " The lesser ports should be furnished with slides — one for glass, the 'other for " Venetian blinds — and should have side ventilators to catch the breeze from the bow. " An iron ship is chosen as less likely to absorb and retain poisonous miasma or " contagion ; and lining the outside with wood, &c, will overcome the objection of the " iron being the greater conductor of heat and cold. " Upper Deck. — The upper deck should be furnished with nettings instead of bulwarks " arising flush from the deck ; or should bulwarks be deemed necessary for safety at sea, " they should be so constructed as to be capable of being removed when at anchor, and " nettings substituted in their stead, otherwise a great source of ventilation will be lost, " and short ventilators rendered comparatively useless. " The saloon and latrines of the officers constituting the staff of the hospital, " together with those of the officers of the ship, should be on this deck if possible ; or in " the event of space not admitting this arrangement, I would recommend a portion of " the bow or main deck to be fitted for this purpose, where I would also have any cabins " for sick officers placed, viz., next in front of the sick soldiers, the object of this distri " bution being to obviate the danger of contagious miasma passing from the sick to the " healthy staff of the hospital..

Yet, though such is the uniform lesson of experience, so deceptive is the salubrious aspect of these airy hills, which swell above the dun and murky air that seems to lie like a mist over the wide bottoms below them, that most people, in choosing their residence, will be guided by their senses in opposition to expe rience. We know not whether the theory by which this fact is explained is a sound one or not. It is said that the miasma or noxious air from putrid ve getation and stagnant water in the swamps and bot toms, is specifically lighter than atmospheric air; that, of course, it rises from the plains, and hovers over the summits of the bluffs, here finding its level of specific gravity ; and that, were it coloured, it would be seen overlaying the purer strata of air be neath it. — The slopes of the Alleghanies, the inte rior of Ohio and Kentucky, of Tennessee and Indi ana, where the forest is cleared away, and the land has been for a sufficient time under cultivation, and where it is sufficiently remote from stagnant waters — ■ the high prairies of Illinois and Missouri, the dry pine woods of the lower and southern country, parts of the plains of Opelousas and Attakapas, considera ble portions of Alabama and Mississippi, and general ly the open country towards the Chippewayan Mountains, may be considered as healthy as any other country. It is a very trite, but a true and im portant remark, that in proportion as the country becomes opened, cultivated, and peopled, in propor tion as the redundance and rankness of natural vege tation is replaced by that of cultivation, the country becomes more healthy.* When it is known that sucn have been precisely the circumstances in which a great portion of the emi grants to the western country have fixed themselves, in open cabins that drink in the humid atmosphere of the night through a hundred crevices, in a new and untried climate, under a higher temperature, un der the operation of a new diet and regimen, and, perhaps, under the depressing influence of severe labour and exposure, need we wonder that the country has acquired a general character of un healthiness 1 With every allowance, however, there can be no doubt, that in the southern and middle re gions of this valley, the wide, level, and heavy tim bered alluvions are intrinsically more or less unheal thy ; neither can it be disguised, that in these situa tions the new resident is subject to bilious com plaints, to remitting fevers, and, more than all, to intermitting fever, or fever and ague. This com plaint is the general scourge of the valley. It is an undoubted fact, explained in different ways and by different theories by the people, that even in the most unfavourable positions, on the low er waters of the Ohio, or even the bayous of the Ar kansas or Red River, the emigrant is not so much exposed to disease while his cabin is still under the shade of the unbroken forest. The most dangerous period is, after the trees have been levelled a year or two, and while they are still decaying about the dwelling. This well-known fact would seem to give plausibility to the doctrine, that these deep and grand forests feed their foliage with an atmosphere that is adverse to the life of man ; and that when the tim ber is cleared away, the miasma, the noxious air, that used to be absorbed and devoured by the redundant vegetation and foliage of the sorest, and incorpora ted with its growth, thus detached and disengaged, and inhaled by the new residents, becomes a source of disease. Another fact, in relation to the choice of a residence, with a view to its salubrity, has been abundantly and unanswerably proved by experience. It is, that bluffs on the margins of wide bottoms and alluvial prairies are more unhealthy than situations in the bottom, or prairie, which they overlook. This fact has been amply demonstrated on the Ohio bottoms and bluffs, on the margins of the alluvial prairies of the upper Mississippi, and, in short, wherever a high bluff overlooks a wide bottom. The inhabitants on the airy and beautiful bluffs that bound the noble prairies of the upper Mis sissippi, in an atmosphere apparently so pure as to preclude all causes of disease, are far more subject to fever and ague than the people that live below them on the level of the prairies ; the same has been re- This section of the work of Mr. Hinton deserves to be enriched with further observations on the climate and diseases of the United States. Several American writers have favoured the public with their observa tions on this subject. Among the earliest of those who have largely contributed to the store of informa tion on this important matter, might be cited Dr. Lionel Chalmers, whose work appeared in 1776. In the Journal of Andrew Ellicot, the reader will find much information on the same head. Dr. Rush's Medical Inquiries and Observations, also contain a large amount of valuable facts, touching the diseases of the American states, for a very considerable period.

" When this matter was first brought under my consideration," continues Professor Daniell, " I was surprised that the nauseous smell which must be necessarily evolved from water impregnated with this gas, at so high a temperature as that of the Equinoctial regions, had not been noticed. I have in consequence turned to some of the accounts of the late travels in Africa, to seek for evidence upon the subject ; and in the Narrative of an Expe dition into the Interior of Africa, by the River Niger, by Macgregor Laird and R. A. B; Oldfield, I found the following important observations : — " The principal predisposing causes of the awful mortality, were, in my opinion, the sudden change from the open sea to a narrow and winding river, the want of the sea-breeze, and the prevalence of the deadly miasma, to which we were nightly exposed from the sur rounding swamps. The horrid sickening stench of this miasma must be experienced to be conceived : no description of it can convey to the mind the wretched sensation, that is felt for some time before and after day-break. In those accursed swamps, one is oppressed not only bodily but mentally with an indescribable feeling of heaviness, languor, nausea, and disgust, which requires a considerable effort to shake off." Another remarkable effect of the water is the injurious effect it has upon the copper sheathing of vessels ; and as the same agent will produce this effect, nothing is wanting to identify this rapid decay of the ships' copper with that .of the mortality of the climate. Although these views are questioned by some, still there is great probability of their being correct, and it is a subject well worthy of suture enquiry.* The narratives of the ill-fated Niger expedition, as well as of every other traveller who visits those regions, will place the mariuer on his guard as to the best means of counteracting the deadly effects of the climate. In the Appendix will be found some medical hints for the preservation of health, which are recommended to attention. Descriptive Remarks and Sailing Directions for the Navigation to and of Western Africa ; with some Account of the Currents, Seasons, Sec; — the Result of Eight Years' actual Experience, in the Command of Four different fVessels, by Captain Thomas Midgley, of Liverpool, 1837.-)- On the Passage from England to the Western Coast of Africa, it maybe well to make the Island of Madeira, and sail to the westward of it if possible; for by so doing the ship will be placed in the best position as to her future course. Aster passing Madeira, steer so as to leave Palma about 70 or 80 miles to the eastward, (if nearer, the ship is liable to be becalmed,) and then steer a course to make the N.E. end of Bonavista.— Bonavista requires a good berth, as the currents about it are strong and uncertain, and dangers extend from the North and East sides to a great distance from the land. In the winter, when strong westerly breezes, of long continuance, prevail to the northward, it may be impossible to make Madeira without much trouble and delay ; in this case, endeavour to get a good observation for longitude, or a sight of the Salvages; and, should westerly winds still continue, run boldly to the southward. On nearing the Canary Islands, you will find the wind either gradually decrease to a calm, or it will veer to the northward with heavy squalls. The squalls in this neighbourhood give little warning, but are frequently exceedingly heavy and dangerous. Any ship may very safely run through the passage to the eastward of Palma, as a strong steady N.N.E. or N.E. breeze almost constantly blows through it ; and by keeping mid-channel, there is little fear of being becalmed. When clear of the Canaries, a course may be shaped to make Bonavista as above directed. The passage between the Islands and Cape Verde is generally and very properly adopted by vessels trading to the Western Coast of Africa ; for, by running to the westward of St. Antonio, they have again to make Easting in that tract of sea which, lying contiguous to the southern limit of the N.E. trade wind, is so often disturbed by calms, squalls, thunder, lightning, and heavy rain. • See also Nautical Magazine, Nov. 1841, pp. 737-8, and Parliamentary Report. App. t In these Remarks, &c. by Captain Midgley, as in the other parts of this volume, the courses and bearings are by compass, unless where otherwise expressed ; and every bearing or direction of the current is intended for the true.

Were a bottleful of miasma such as we inhale therein collected, what a deadly poison instan taneous in its action, undiscoverable in its pro perties, would lie ! Horrors upon horrors are in it. Boas above and snakes and scorpions under our feet; land crabs, terrapins, and iguanas move about in our vicinity ; malaria is in the air we breathe, the road is infested with hot-water ants which bite our legs until we dance and squirm about like madmen. Yet somehow we are for tunate enough to escape annihilation there, and many another traveller might also. Yet here in verity are the ten plagues of Egypt, through which a traveller in these regions runs the gauntlet. i. Plague of boas. 2. Red ants or hot water. 3. Scorpions. 4. Thorns and spear cacti. 5.

Stanley writes : " As we reached the middle of the town I saw on the steps of a large white house a white man in flannels and helmet similar to that I wore. He was young and reddish whiskered, he had a light, lively humorous face, while his head was slightly inclined on one side, which gave him somewhat of a pensive appearance. I thought myself rather akin to white men in general, and I walked up to him. He advanced towards me, and we shook hands, did anything but em brace. " ' Won't you walk in ?' said he. " ' Thanks.' " ' What will you have to drink — beer, stout, brandy? Eh, by George, I congratulate you on your success,' said he impetuously. " I knew him immediately ; he was an Eng lishman. It is their habit to do things, but it was different in Central Africa. Splendid suc cess ! Is that the view they take of it ? It is better still. But how does he know anything of it ? Oh, I forgot ; my messengers have been talking, I see. " ' Thanks ; I will take anything you like to give me.' " ' Let's have some beer, boy ; quick ! It swimming across at the same time, holding on the rope, with the ends of the poles resting on the men's shoulders, I thought would be enabled to carry over a seventy-pound box with ease. In a short time one of these was made, and six couple ofthe strongest swimmers were prepared, and stimulated with a rousing glass of stiff grog each man, with a promise of cloth to each man if they succeeded in getting everything ashore if un damaged by the water. When I saw with what ease they dragged themselves across, the barrow on their shoulders, I wondered that I had not thought of the plan before. Within an hour after the first couple had gone the entire expe dition was safe on the eastern bank, and at once breaking camp we marched north through the swampy forest, which in some places was covered with four feet of water. Seven hours constant splashing brought us to Rehencko." After ex periencing several queer accidents, the farther they went the worse matters became, but they were not to be daunted, and they all felt, as Mr. Stanley says, " even the water — we were getting quite amphibious — was better than the horrible filth and piles of decaying vegetation which were swept against the boma of the village." It was evident as he went on that an unusual storm had swept over the land. In some parts the trees seemed to lay in swathes ; the stronghold of Kesabengo was no more, the aspect of the Ma gerengeri valley was completely changed ; from a paradise it was converted into a howling waste ; according to one report nearly one hundred vil lages had been swept away. Let us quote the native account of the floods. Mussondi the Diwan says that the inhabitants had gone to rest as usual, as they had ever since he had settled in the valley, twenty-five years ago, when in the middle of the night they heard a roar like many thunders, which woke them up to the fact that death was at work in the shape of an enormous volume of water that like a wall came tearing down the tallest trees with it, carrying away scores of villages at one fell sure swoop into utter destruction. The scene six days after the event, when the river had subsided into its normal breadth and depth during the monsoons was simply awful. Wher ever they looked they found something of the devastation that had visited the country, fields of corn covered with many feet of sand and debris. Here is a description of a jungle. " What dreadful odours and indescribable loathing this jungle produces ! It is so dense that a tiger

003586515	003586515_163	[SECTION I. 80 SUNDA STRAIT TO BANKA STRAIT AND BATAVIA. Pari, eastern island of the group, is 1 m. in length ; thickly wooded, and inhabited by a few fishermen. Other islets are thickly wooded, but small, and lie westward of Pari. Brushwood grows on a patch of coral between western extreme of the reef and Tikus, the W. islet. Jong (Junk) Island, lying half a mile eastward of the Agenietens, is of coral sand, always above water, and usually seen 2 m. off. Edge of its reef is steep-to, with depths of 20 to 25 fathoms around. Buoy. A black beacon buoy marks S. side of 3-fathom shoal, Junk Reef, which lies 1 cable eastward from Jong Reef, with depths of 20 fathoms around. Note. — Directions for western approaches to Batavia will follow Batavia Bay and Road (p. 84). BATAVIA BAY, between Untung Java Point westward, and Kerawang Point on the E., occupies 20 ni., and between Edam Island and Batavia the distance is 9 m. Dangerous shoals are marked by buoys. Depths in the bay decrease gradually from 14 or 15 fathoms near Edam Island towards the shore ; bottom is mud, mixed with sand near reefs. Coast of the bay fronting Batavia is a muddy marsh, from 1 to IJ m. in width, cut into by shallow streams, some of which have been converted into canals navigable for boats. Southward of the sea-coast marshes, for 5 or 6 m. E. and W. of the town, are low-lying lands, rice fields, native gardens, etc., intersected by canals. BATAVIA. Batavia (lower town) formerly stood on the sea, but advance of the shore has been such that it is now 1 m. from it. Training walls of the river or canal have been advanced from time to time, and are nearly IJ m. in length, a passage for boats being left in the eastern pier, abreast the main light. Old Town is covered with stone buildings arranged in squares and intersected by canals, which are traversed by numerous bridges. Principal channel running through middle of the town is from 160 to 180 ft. wide. The place is unhealthy, and merchants and officials retire to southern suburbs as soon as the day's business is over, thus partly avoiding the miasma arising from swamps, which is carried seaward by a land-wind prevailing at night. S. of Old Batavia is the closely packed Chinese and native town, of about 1 square m., also intersected by canals. The great suburb of New Batavia (upper town, with villas, gardens, native bazaars, barracks and drill ground) lies 5 m. southward of the piers. It is also intersected by canals, but they are less numerous. Naval establishments are on Onrust and Kuiper Islands. See p. 83. Population of Batavia (including suburbs) is about 170,000, comprising 6000 Europeans, 24,000 Chinese, and 140,000 Javanese, Malays, and other natives. Climate. Lower town of Batavia is rendered unhealthy by exhalations from marshes along foreshore of the bay. Inland, the island is more healthy. Batavia fever prevails at change of monsoons, more particularly about October, or latter part of dry season. Vessels intending to make a long stay in the road are recommended to anchor well off shore, to avoid, as much as possible, the miasma thrown off shore by land-wind. Sleeping on shore should he avoided. Mean temperature, morning and evening, is from 70° to 74° ; at noon, from 80° to 82°, occasionally rising to 90°. N.W. monsoon begins early in November, and its strong winds and heavy rains greatly cool the atmosphere. Climate is moist, rain falling during every month ; greatest falls occur from December to March, and least from July to September. Cholera, in an epidemic form, carried off 48,000 persons in Java and Madura during four months ending December 1881. Trade. Exports are : Sugar, coffee, rice, tea, indigo, tobacco, tin, ratans, spices, and chin chona bark. Imports are : Cotton goods, coal, iron, copper, lead, earthenware, and spirits. Aggregate value of exports for the Island of Java (1885) was £9,330,000 ; and imports, £4,352,000. Total arrival of vessels at Batavia in 1884, including coasting craft, amounted to 909, of 1,900,000 tons ; departures were 915, of these 170 were British, and 653 Dutch. Telegraphs. Batavia is connected by electric telegraph with principal towns in Java, and by submarine cables with all parts of the world. With Europe, by way of Singapore ; with Australia, by cable from Banjouwangie to Port Darwin ; and with Sumatra, by cable from Anjer to Kalianda. Mails. Direct communication is maintained between Batavia and Holland by three lines of steamers ; the Netherland Steam Navigation Company despatch a steamer every ten days. Fortnightly mail service is maintained with Singapore. Monthly steamers of the Queensland Royal Mail line, carrying mails from Aden, call here. A French company run steamers every three weeks between Java and Marseilles ; there are also intermediate steamers.

With care, if a man's con stitution be sound, a man may live here as long as anywhere. In the interior parts of the colony the purity of the air is proverbial, and especially in the dry season. At night the stars appear like brilliants in the deep azure sky, and even in the daytime planets can be sometimes seen. In the lowlands and the swampy places we get the miasma and the fever, but the highlands and the forests are never found to be unhealthy to Europeans.

Perhaps — and I am sorry this thought, which I mention to you only, should oc cur to me — perhaps the clergy themselves are at fault. Are they, in Spain, equal to their mission? Do they go among the people, teaching and preaching to them? Are they all capable of this? Have those who consecrate themselves to a religious life and to the salvation of souls a true vocation for their calling? Or is it only a means of living, like any other, with this difference, that in our day only the poorest, only those who are without ex pectations and without means, devote themselves to it, for the very reason that this calling offers a less brilliant prospect than any other? Be that as it may, the very scarcity of learned and virtuous priests arouses all the more within me the desire to be a priest." J 1 [Page 23, " Pepita Ximinez," by Juan Valera. Copyright, 18S6, by D.

The sickly character which this new settlement had earned for itself, origi nated from causes which in Victoria are now nearly eradicated. The great cause of sickness, in the early period of our occupation, arose from a resi dence in badly-built houses, with floors barely removed from the damp earth ; often times within the influence of the miasma arising from marshes, or the noxious gases of newly turned-up earth. The churches, post-office, barracks, and other public buildings, are very creditable. The club-house is on an extensive scale, and, being open to visitors, with a proper intro duction, is perhaps the cause of the little

Its position was most insalubrious, for the marshy swamps commenced at the very base of hills, and thus as it were encircled the Savannahs with a belt of miasma. The ague, which is usually accompanied by fever, is of a kind very difficult to shake off, gradually weakening the sufferer till he sinks under its influ ence; the natives themselves are by no means free from its strokes, to which attacks every stranger who remains for many days in the vicinity of the marshes is liable. Though a veil of mystery still covers the particulars of poor Moorcroft's fate, it seems more than probable that he fell a victim to the fever of this country, though the seed that was sown did not mature till some time after he had quitted it.

Just now he is chastening the blacks, among whom much sickness prevails, while, except from a bilious fever, not dangerous, the whites are free.

Here not only will one not clean your shoes that cleans your knives, but the master, if he would have his work done, must keep on the watch and see that his orders are executed. Yet when the rates of pay are considered, Reader, you will not be astonished that they do so little. As I cannot suppose in any endroit in the known world labour is cheaper, I give the following list as much as a curiosity as a guide to suture visitors.

The cowries appeared to be the property of the lucky ones who caught them, but the cloths were instantly handed to the riders, and if not, a fight ensued that was terrible to behold. The naked multitude emitted an efflu vium only to be compared to the fetid atmosphere of a slave ship ; and as the mass oscillated there arose a vapour like the miasma of a swamp, as they were perfectly bathed with perspiration. Besides throwing gifts to the soldiers, his Majesty was all smiles, and liberality in his donations to the ministers, and a num ber of others (as a reference to the pro gramme will show) ; but to no one was any large sum given. At one time he sent us a basket containing ten heads of coAvries and tAvo pieces of cloth as a present, and at another a constant supply of cowries and cloths to scramble among the mob.

We were therefore very anxious to obtain shelter. After vainly endeavouring to obtain a night's quarters for ourselves and our horses at some of the miserable sheds belonging to the peasants, we at once proceeded into the court-yard of the best looking house in the village, and which hap pened to be that of the agha, making our way through an assembly of barking curs, camels, mules, and asses. That worthy chief surveyed us with no small portion of curiosity and surprise ; but when we deliberately put up our horses in his stable, supplied them with provender, and then entered his house, his astonishment gave way to indignation, and he vented his rage in a torrent of abuse, in which he was joined by the whole of the women of his household. I have always observed, among half-civilized nations, that gentleness was either received as

The actual time I occupied in crossing the Isthmus from the Pacific to the Atlantic, deducting the delay at Cruces, was seventeen hours, eight hours from Panama to Cruces, and nine from Cruces to Chagres. On landing I made inquiries for a custom house officer to pass my baggage, as I was de sirous, if possible, of availing myself of the light to get up to the fort where the miasma is less fatal than below, and I had procured a letter to the governor for this especial purpose. After a rare hunt to find the officer, I returned in despair to the canoe with the intention of pushing off immediately on board one of the schooners for the night, but the boatmen had all disappeared. This was because it had very naturally occurred to them, having nothing else to do, that they might as well go in search of a little gin to mix with the rain which now fell in torrents. I had no umbrella, so I stood for some time, at the edge of the water, with

A female emeute is a puz zler, for one does not know what course to take to disperse it, (unless it be with fire-engines,) and therefore the bread riots in Constantinople are frequently successful. After that, plague came on us breathing hot and deadly. On which people incontinently quitted the bounds of propriety. Sundry pre cautions were at once adopted, as useless in reality, as absurd in the eyes of many who care not for them. When you enter the house of an alarmist, at such times, whether on business or through courtesy, you are put in the first place into a kind of sentry-box which stands by the door : that is closed on you. A chafing-dish, containing herbs of villanous odour, is placed under the grating on which your feet rest, and you are left to the mercy of the porter. Should the smoke make you sneeze, he will retain you in longer, for sneezing is symptomatic of disorder. After being nigh stifled and blinded, you are let out, and admitted into the presence-chamber, from which every article of furniture which can hold miasma is removed. Your friend still keeps

With this view an upper apartment should be chosen as a bed-chamber, and those windows fronting the marshy ground, when the house is to the leeward, kept«hut, while those on the opposite side may be suffered to remain open, to admit of a free ventilation. By an attention to these few hints, experience and observation warrant us in affirming that Europeans and new settlers, would, for the most part, escape those diseases to which, merely through want of precaution, they so frequently fall victims. Lieut. Jn. Evans, (a) R. N. in some observations relative to the same subject, has noticed that, if possible, to avoid it, tbe stern of a vessel should never lie in such a situation as to meet the miasma of undrained morasses ; for otherwise you will receive the pestilential air into your cabin, the windows of which may require to be open all night, and even then you may be bathed in perspiration. — Colombian Navigator, Vol. I. part 2, page 106.

Near Valenciennes we broke a tire, and were detained two hours. Here the garrison was still stronger, the place in better condition, and the troops mounted guard with their marching accoutrements about them ; all of which, I presume, was owing to the fact, that this is the last forti fied town on the road. We did not get to the frontier until seven, and the French posti lions broke another bolt before we got fairly rid of them, compelling us to wait an hour to have it mended. We were now in a low wet country, or one perfectly congenial to cholera ; it was just the hour when the little demons of miasma are said to be the most active, and to complete the matter, we learned that the disease was in the village. The carriage-windows were closed, while I walked about, from door to door, to pacify uneasi ness by curiosity. Use, however, had made us all tolerably indifferent, and little P settled the matter by remarking it was no-

In the present case, therefore, it can state that the aim of the following pages has been to import sundry African facts into England ; that these facts re gard a colony little visited and little known, but, like all matters little known, the ground of much theory. Few spots upon the earth's face have been so uniformly pronounced deformities without having been seen. None hesitate to condemn it. It is deemed a land of miasma, contagion, and death. It bears the terrific and poetic title of the " White Man's Grave." Its aspect is generally suspected to present a uniformity of flats,

The earth is extravagant in its display of resources, as in every tropical spot where moisture abounds. The paths of the forest near the capital, although daily crushed with footsteps, impede progress by an obstinate renewal of vegetation. The very streets of Freetown, trodden by thousands, at some periods of the year require to be constantly mowed ; so ra pidly, so perseveringly do the indigo, the jalap, and other plants assert their right to flourish. Around the European dis tricts the ground has been cleared in most directions by conflagration ; and the sea breeze, constant in its daily coming, sweeps off much of the vapour that might otherwise linger. Whatever the face of the country for merly, nothing denotes generation of fatal miasma at the present day. On the dis tant coast by False Cape, when at sea I have seen mists hanging in the morning :

" Reasoning on the generally received principle that air at a high temperature occasions a greater degree of exhalation from bodies than cool air does, and from what we know the influence of summer heat to be in other countries, we should suppose that diseases caused by miasma tous matter should be here more common in summer than in winter ; but our ac quaintance with this climate induces us to think differently on this subject. " Here, in summer, the air of the atmo sphere is uniformly clear and cloudless ; and the emanations from the earth's sur face, meeting neither clouds nor mists to impede their ascent, mingle with the other atmospherical ingredients, and diffuse them selves freely through the regions of space.

The frogs, snakes, and mosquitoes were in a condition of lively vigour, and, de spite the towers, the cloisters, the oriel windows, the rich chancels, peeping from every flowery nook of the tangled foliage (matters so at tractive to the owners of block books, pencils, and a taste for the picturesque), we felt that we were little better than the foolish, in thus wooing miasma, in her favourite haunt.

Let the passengers then beware of deadly miasma. Fever and ague lurk in every whiff of the night air, as it is borne to them from the jungle around. Let them shut their ca bins close, to keep the death-dealing vapour out — close as they can — and if the occupant rejoices in a pair of whiskers — I must not say in a beard, for Englishmen have no beards — let him smoke a cigar within the narrow confines of his cabin.

My querist was of opinion that this arose from a kind of intuitive perception in the flies as to the exact amount of sustenance likely to be obtained in different apart ments. I confess I am unable to solve the problem myself. Donkeys offer the safest means of transit to those who wish to visit the celebrated convent on Mount Carmel. The fare is three piastres (about sixpence), and the road is almost impracticable to horses. I was so sick of Caipha, and so ill from the atmosphere I breathed there, that I cheerfudy avaded myself of the invitation of an hospitable monk, to pass three days on the top of Elijah's Mountain. Half an hour's jogging brought me within the precincts of the holy convent, and right glad was I to find myself wed out of the walls of that most wretched town of Caipha, and high above the reach of its baneful miasma.

In fact, as an English ship-master once pithily remarked to me, they look more like " church yard deserters " than living beings. The British Consulate's residence had been burnt by the Egyptian troops before evacuating Syria, and the Vice-Consul was consequently compelled, whilst it was under repair, to five in the hovel in which I found him. It was, however, about the best house then at Alexan dretta. It had one upper room supported on two spars, which used to shake and tremble like reeds at every gust of wind. The miser able shutters went on slides, and when once they were shut, it was impossible to open them again, without the co-operation of all the ser vants, which indeed was also needed to shut them.

There is one entrance facing the sea. It now stands exactly in the centre of an inaccessible marsh, with only a thread of rising ground from the gateway to the beach. Well indeed might the factors have been short-lived in those days. However comfortable and well furnished, or however lofty and dry their apartments, however abundant the necessaries and luxuries of life, (and they are said to have been rare bon-vivants), every breath they inhaled was charged with poisonous miasma, and vapours noxious with putrified vegetable and animal matter. Hence arose the circumstance of the archives of the Aleppo Consulate containing so many melancholy records of the untimely fates of these unhappy men. Here, one reads of the appointment of Mr. Smith to be factor at Alexandretta, and a dozen pages afterwards there is an entry of his sudden illness and death : so his successor,

The climate is anything but healthy ; and Larnaca, like a great number of Eastern towns, is surrounded by marsh miasmas. The trade is inconsiderable. Plenty of vessels frequent the port, but they merely come for the purpose of buying provisions, which are both cheap and good. French and Italian vessels, which are homeward bound, lay in a stock of wine and biscuit here for the use of the crews, and the biscuits of Larnaca are, in my opinion, equal to those made in any part of Europe.

I am not aware that examination of the bogs shows any marks of natural and pe riodical conflagrations ; and Ireland owes it to the climatic influences of its geographical position, that while it is free from the droughts and conflagrations of other unre claimed regions, the presence of so much moisture does not generate the miasma that broods over wastes under a southern sun, or the aguish chills of inland swamps. A reprint of selections from Prize essays of the Highland and other societies and old authors, on the subject of the improvement of moors, bogs, and mosses, would be useful ; it would certainly perform acts of justice to some original thinkers, at the expense of compilers not confessing their obligations.

But the harbour, as a naval and commercial station, may be deemed a failure, notwithstanding the large sums of money that have been expended upon it from time to time by the French government, and must remain so until the jete'e is carried out further into the sea, so as to be able to receive vessels at low water ; and certainly one of the chief desagre'mens of this town is the offensive miasma arising from the mud in the harbour when the tide is out, and which aggravated the virulence of the cholera when that pestilence visited the town in 1849.

We returned to Galandos with improved appetites for our dinner, but we presently heard news that made us feel less keen. The dreaded and malignant cholera was ac tually in the town ; it had been brought, or had travelled, from Aksher three days ago — several persons had already fallen victims to it yesterday and to day, and some after an illness of only two hours. It was committing dreadful devastation in the village of Balee, through which we had passed, but in ignorance of its being there. We could not but consider it as providential, that we took our walk to the bazaar, and had been detained so long. Had we spent the afternoon at Galandos, we should have been wandering about the town, and been exposed to the conta gion.

Elephantiasis is indeed here more common, but this fright ful disease does not disqualify the patient for bodily labour.

Thus the mephitic vapours, min- gling together, are diffused by the wind, which, instead of bringing health to the inhaler, presents a poisonous draught : still, unhealthy as the cli- mate is now, it has much improved since the swamp nearest the town has been reclaimed, previous to which, and when medical men did not so well understand the nature of the fevers, the average duration of human life was three months ; but, if the year in which I was there may be taken as a criterion, it is now five years, — ten out of fifty white people having died in one month. The climate of the adjacent country, where the baneful mangrove swamps do not exist, is by no means so insalubrious as that of the Island of Bathurst, and not worse than some parts of England. But as there is no verdure in the island ; as

Cranston's curate and his belongings. Whenever the Curate of Cranston felt himself over come by the melancholy miasma of the place, and sorely inclined to think within himself, " How much longer must my health and strength be expended on those who heed not the outlay, and seem none the better for it ? How much longer must I remain in a parish where I am cut off from so much that is con genial to my tastes ?" — whenever despondency in duced him to soliloquize after this fashion, then there would come the thought of his widowed mother, and he would beat down his dispiriting fancies, and say, " Here is my lot ; my path is clearly marked out for me ; let me only strive to walk in it cheerfully, and to do my duty to God and man." And that same day, perhaps, he would send such a letter home to the dis tant county, where, with her niece, his mother lived in humble retirement, that the widow's eyes would b 3

These lakes and bayous drying during summer, and exposing to the rays of the sun millions of dead fish, impregnate the atmosphere with miasma, ge nerating typhus, yellow fever, dysenteries, and pulmonary diseases. If the reader will look over the map I have sketched of the Shoshone country, he will perceive how well the land is watered; the lakes are all transparent and deep, the rivers run upon a rocky bottom as well as all the brooks and creeks, the waters of which are always cool and plentiful. One more observation to con vince the reader of the superiority of the clime is, that, except a few ants in the forests, there are no insects whatever to be found. No mus- quitoes, no prairie horse-flies, _.■"> beetles, except the coconilla or large phosphoric fly of Califor nia, and but very few worms and caterpillars ; the

I have twice had the slow fever, in its nature and conse quences so similar to the yellow fever of the West Indies, and that of Walcheren, but not so ultimately debilitating as the latter, and both times, I imagine, that it was caught by exposure to marsh miasma. The inexperienced sportsman in Upper Canada must beware of long exposure, during the heat of the day, in following duck shoot ing ; he must beware of remaining long wet, and above all, must never sleep in the sun, if wearied. Few escape who devote much time to shooting, and few settlers in the woods remain long in the country without ague. The lake fever is more prevalent in marshy districts, or on the immediate borders of Erie and Ontario, if the locality be not well drained. It acts by unnerving the whole system, without pain, and most frequently also attacks the mind, in that species of de lirium called wandering. Happily, however,

Like many others, however, excitement and hard work seemed to steel him against disease, though inhaling the poisonous miasma exhaled from the swamps and paddy which surrounded our posi tion. It was on the passage down the river that sickness made its appearance in the force, and Sir Fleming was destined to be the first to sink under it. On the morning of the 13th of June, when it was announced to him that all hopes of saving his life was at an end, he immediately directed that the signal be made for all captains of H. M.'s ships to repair on board ; but ere the first had arrived, our gallant commodore was a corpse. He carried with him to the grave the regret of all. " He participated in all the privations that the troops underwent on the heights above Canton, and has fallen a victim to the zeal that marked his character." He was buried at Macao, and a monument was erected over his remains by a joint subscription of the officers of the army and navy. On the 22nd of June, Commodore Sir Gordon

That this has been a very unhealthy season is certain, but still, from all the information I could obtain, there is a great mortality every year in the districts I have pointed out ; and such indeed must be the case, from the miasma created every fall of the year in these rich al luvial soils, some portions of which have been worked for fifty years without the assistance of manure, and still yield abundant crops. It will be a long while before the drainage necessary to render them healthy can be accomplished. The sickly appearance of the inhabitants establishes but too well the facts related to me ; and yet, strange to say, it would appear to be a provision of Providence, that a remarkable fecundity on the part of the women in the more healthy por tions of their Western States, should meet the annual expenditure of life.

There were many difficulties in the way of our journey to be overcome; from our constant stoppages and short stages, the Coolies prepared for our palkees were very difficult to procure, and the dak had to be continually fresh laid. There were pes tilential miasmas to be guarded against, and rivers to be forded, swollen to a formid able extent by sudden showers.

When prevented going out from inclemency of weather, it is nevertheless, advisable to rise early and occupy the mind with some employ- ment or pursuit. Many hope to ward off illness by extreme abstinence, but that is perhaps equally inimical to the constitution as intemperance; either excess is bad, and I am decidedly of opinion, that the constant, or frequent use of pepper, spices, hot dishes, such as curry and pepperpot, must be detri- mental ; an opinion that is indeed combated by numbers, who imagine, on the contrary, that those fiery ingredients and aliments are more salubrious than simple viands, that theyare cooling, in lieu of being inflammatory,

The buildings, which cannot fail to attract the attention of the most casual observer, as being far more magnificent, as well as better situated than any others, are the store-houses, or here called " go-downs," of Messrs.

Many private dwellings have been commenced, somewhat more removed from the sea, in this neighbourhood, in a valley called by the Chinese, Wang-ni-chong, or the " Valley of the Winding Shore ;" most of them have as yet proved very unhealthy, and in conse- quence been little inhabited. This I be- lieve to be chiefly owing to two causes, their secluded position — being almost shut out either from the sea or land breezes, and partly by reason of the paddy cultivation which still exists in the valleys in their vicinity, and secondly from the neighbour ing hills being encumbered with shrubs and tangled woods, miasma from the paddy-

It was the first time the ship had gone there, and the captain was continually going half-speed, to avoid arriving too early at the different places at which we had to stop at night, and in con sequence, we generally arrived so late in the morning that we had to remain another day before weighing anchor. We stopped a day and a half at Delagoa Bay— a terribly fever-haunted spot. The town is built in front of a marsh, the miasma arising from it being plainly seen in the evening, in the shape of a white, hot mist. They are trying in a futile manner to drain it, and have planted blue-gum-trees all about, but it is doubtful if much good will result from their efforts : du reste, the scenery of the Bay is quite as uninteresting as is usual on the East Coast of Africa, and the natives even more hideous.

The corruption of hundreds of thousands of human bodies has, below ground, polluted the springs of water, while, above, it is a well known fact that the miasma from the corpses of the inhabitants of London first attaches itself to, and then corrupts, meat suspended in the larders of the neighbourhood; and thus people of fashion and high rank, and in beautiful clothes, every day ghoul-like drink up and eat up a portion of the carcases of their dead ! It is not so in Paris. In addition to the ceme tery of Pere la Chaise for the eastern district, there are that of Montmartre for the northern, that of Mont Parnasse for the southern, besides a cemetery appropriated for the use of hospitals and for the interment of criminals.

The learning of Paraclese was nearly unparalleled ; and the volumes of Ray maun are still invaluable to those who would write of ancient history and diplomacy. The poets and painters are also nume rous. We find in the lives of nearly all these men remarkable and interesting incidents exhibiting their moral heroism in over coming obstacles, their struggles with poverty, their sufferings and trials in painful positions, which are the surest proofs of the genius which inspired them. Our plan and limits do not admit of our relating these things, but so much we cannot help seeing and saying, that the air of republicanism is not the miasma it has been represented, blighting to every germ of talent, and covering with mildew all the fruits of genius. It cannot be true, because it is contrary to all the laws of God and nature, that freedom should not be a healthful sustenance for the soul of man.

Although the mineral resources of the country are undoubt edly rich, its future wealth will come, if peace can ever be made permanent, from the development of the agricultural and timber lands. Bey7ond the mining district down to the Mosquito coast there extends a forest of immense area, filled Avith the finest woods, and it has scarcely been touched. The most useful timber is the mahogany, although there are kin dred varieties quite as good, but not so popular or well THE KING OF THE MOSQUITOES. known. It is more easily obtained too, as it grows upon the ridges and keeps out of the swamps, which are full of miasma and mosquitoes. The tree is one of the most beautiful, as well as one of the largest, that are found in tropical lands, commonly reaching a height of sixty or seventy feet, and being from twenty-five to forty feet in circumference. Timbers forty feet long and eight feet square are frequent, although so heavy that they are difficult to handle ; and the only way fine timber can be obtained is by taking saw-mills into the forest and cut- lo

The total expense of making the necessary reservoirs in Oran will amount to upwards of three million francs; and these the settlers propose that the State should advance, promising in their turn to keep in perpetual repair the tanks and canals connected with them. They offer also to pay to Government from twenty to thirty francs for every acre watered in summer, and from two to ten francs for every acre watered in winter, according to a tariff to be drawn up for different districts. The entire sum was calculated to be about 200,000 francs per annum. Water is of such vital importance to the colonists that they are willing to make any sacrifices in order to obtain it. There is a territory in the plains of the Habra which lets for £5 an acre, because there is a stream running through it ; while at Thelat, only ten miles from Oran, there exists a property of 900 acres, with considerable buildings, and

The Gironde presents a great variety of surface : being flat, cheerless, and monotonous in the Landes, or the plains nearest the sea, and abounding with agreeable and romantic landscapes in the opposite direction. It is about thirty leagues long and twenty four broad. The climate is generally mild and temperate. The thermometer seldom descends below 0 in winter ; in summer it rises to 20° and 25° : the winds are generally from the south-west and north-west quarters. The miasma, exhaled from the marshes exposed to the burning heat of the sun, alone interrupts the general salubrity of this country, which, after all, figures among those that are the most remarkable for longevity. This department, justly considered as one of the richest in France, from the repute of its wines and the extensive commerce of its principal towns, is perhaps, the one which presents the greatest quantity of sterile or uncultivated land. Besides the Garonne already mentioned, the plains of the Gironde are also watered by the Dordogne, a fine river, which rising also in the Pyrenees, receives the tributary streams of the Lot, the Tarn, the Aveyron, and the Arriege, and being received by the Garonne, at a point called Bee d'Ambes, forms with that river the immense estuary called the Gironde. The other rivers are the Ille, which, after receiving

Moreover, there is a regular sea breeze, and this, together with the heavy dews, tends materially to mitigate the fierce temperature of a climate seldom cooled by rain in twenty-five degrees north latitude, on the verge of the tropic. Finally the dry sod, the deposit of the river, and the debris of the rocks, breeds none of that fearful miasma which arises from the jungly swamps near the embouchures of the Indus, and renders the Delta a formidable rival to the Pontine Marshes. But Kurrachee, like Aden, Muscat, Bushire, and other similar places, though generaUy speaking salubrious enough, has recurring crises of sickness, suffering severely from the visitation of epidemics, cholera, dysentery, and fever, and at such times shows bills of mortality which shame even Sierra Leone, celebrated as she justly is for her habit of running up a long account of that nature.

Miasma, coil ing like a wet snake round the lungs, is a curative process rather difficult of belief. But change of scene works miracles. It flutters the blood, breaks up the lethargy of monotonous habits, and sets the springs of life going with renewed elasticity. Observe that obese, middle-aged gentleman, in the broad-leafed, fawn-coloured travelling hat, how he stands gazing at the odd costumes of the people in the market-place. At home he doesn't walk two miles a-day, on an average, spends a couple of hours of a morn ing over the newspaper, and crawls about, very much after the manner of a turtle, till dinner-time. Now, ever since he has come abroad he has been in a perpetual flurry ; clambering up old cathedral towers, and driving about to ruins and museums, palaces, and picture-galleries, from the moment he gets out of bed tiU he gets into it again. He is thinner, and fighter, and airier already ; and begins to chuckle and crack jokes with a sprightliness which quite alarms his famUy. The novelty of the transition awakens his whole faculty of observation, such as it is ; and the perpetual motion has given wings to his animal sphits.

The white cliffs sketched beyond, form the western boundary of the island at Colwell Bay, and terminate with the Needle Rocks. It is a wretched prison-house, gloomy, with miasma in every breath of air, and in the room said to have been the King's, are " King Charles' Golden Rules," placed there by himself. As to the Castle itself, it is one of the block-houses built by Henry VIII., and is still occupied by troops. We proceeded by railway, through a beautiful portion of the New Forest, to SOUTHAMPTON, at present, by its connection with the Railway, its fine Harbour, Docks, and judicious improve ments, rising, perhaps, to be the equal of any port in England, and already ranking, both in amount of tonnage and exports, before Bristol, and next to Hull.

The backwater lies between the sea and can tonment, and between the former and the latter there are thick clustering plantations of cocoa-nut trees, the tops of which are almost on a level with the houses, situated upon a sort of high cliffy ground. The consequence is, that when the tide is out, and nothing but mud in the river, the sea breezes drive all the miasma right through those trees into the cantonment, rendering it really un healthy. In addition to this evil, the quantity of rain which pours incessantly during the monsoon ren- n2

How very odd, that our clever doctors, our wise-headed medical boards, should not have such things reformed ! But to proceed. The church (apparently an old one) is also in the Old Town.* In this place of worship, service is performed twice a day every Sunday, by a clergyman belonging to the station, and to which the European pensioners are regularly marched. The native part of the town is a little further to the southward, on the outskirts and along the inner bank of the river; the huts are closely built, and the population considerable. There being no regular place alotted for the hutting of our men, they were obliged to locate themselves wherever they could find lodgings, for the which, by the way, they had to pay very high rent ; and this was hard upon the poor fel lows, considering they receive no allowance to make up for such contingencies, their own houses at regimental head-quarters falling to ruins in the meantime. The pensioners' lines in the Old Town are exten sive, and present a strange medley of neatness and cleanliness, together with filth and dirt commingled, * It belongs, I believe, to the missionaries.

The environs, with their extensive gardens, are beautiful and picturesque ; while the town being partly situated on a rising eminence, and partly in a pleasant valley, with its wide-spread ing suburbs scattered about on the surrounding heights, and mingling with the pretty forms of the domes and spires, impresses the traveller with the idea that he is about to enter a very con siderable city, rich and populous. But in these favourable anticipations, he will be miserably dis appointed ; and whatever may have been the former grandeur of Jassy, it is now reduced to a level with one of the wretched capitals of the east. The streets, like the roads, are unpaved, ex cept one or two of the principal, and these are merely boarded, a channel for conveying away the filth of the street being formed underneath ; but, owing to the slovenliness of the inhabitants, and the entire absence, we presume, of any sani tary police to enforce cleanliness, it is suffered to accumulate for months, thus poisoning the atmo sphere and engendering a miasma sufficient to create a pestilence.

For the last ten days the weather has been re markably mild for this climate ; but, while I was congratulating myself on a temperature from which I felt much less inconvenience than I expected, the very unseasonable change was productive of much anxiety here. A severe degree of frost is ne cessary at this season, not merely to the health, but to the very existence of the people. If the miasma from the marshy soil is not checked and kept down by the nipping frost, malaria will arise, producing various and contagious diseases : if there is not sufficient snow on the ground to form a trainage on the roads for sledges, all com munication with the interior becomes difficult, or absolutely intercepted ; and, lastly, the supplies of the capital, which depend almost entirely on the stocks of frozen provisions received from all parts of the country, if curtailed of these resources by the mildness of the season, may eventually be come so scarce, that a famine would be the ulti mate consequence : to this may be added the loss which must accrue to the farmer and peasant

The form of government in this province, as in all the rest, is based upon the example of that of Buenos Ayres ; consisting of a popular assembly, Avhich has the power of electing the Governor. But though democratic in theory, it is far othenvise in practice : the lower orders have not the smallest notion of the real meaning of a representative form of govern ment, and boAV with submission to the dictates of a patriarchal coterie of influential families, which, alternately electing and elected, arrange the govern ment amongst themselves very much as suits their OAvn convenience and interests.

The real marsh, with its rank herbage, we had already traversed, and for some miles, in all the unwholesome mist of morning. The greenness all around, so unusual in Italy, is the same at Tre Ponti as at Cisterna, though there they deny any miasma. I do not believe them, nor think Cisterna a proper place to sleep at. These then are the awful Paludes Pomptinœ, where death held or resumed his long millenium till Pius the Sixth so ably overthrew him. A good deed, doubtless. But unless the black troops of the church militant sought to testify to how few opportunities they sind to use their throats in such laudations, I don't see why they should set up such a yell on the occasion.

Doubling the Punta della Campanella, the south eastern extremity of the bay, in the evening, we traversed the old Sinus Posidonius to the strand of Pæstum, by night, of which I pass the events, odd though they were, and, diving in medias res, wade through the rolling surf of Pæstum's shoaly shore an hour after sunrise. The laughter and the confusion, the duckings diverse, to the damage of female nervous systems and mantillas, and all that, it is needless to tell.

It now forms the boundary of the three empires of Turkey, Persia, and Russia. August 24th. — Our road led to-day through a fertile and well-watered district, abounding in corn-fields and rice and cotton plantations. It was the first time that I had seen rice so nearly ripe, and for some time I mistook it for barley, which it resembles in all but height. Both rice and cotton require con stant irrigation ; and beneath this hot sun the miasma which arises from these plantations is extremely unhealthy. At this season the villages of Armenia offer a picture of great abundance, large heaps of wheat and barley being collected round them for the purpose of being trodden out by oxen, — the Eastern sub stitute for the flail. To-day I marked a decided

The natives of the East do not fear imported plague : unless generated in the place they have no apprehension about it. The disease rarely travels far ; if conveyed to another place by an individual, it dies there with him. Three times I have resided in cities with the plague, but in no instance did it extend ten miles off, though merchandise, and Tartars, and travellers, came and went as usual. In June, July, and August, 1836, plague carried off eight thousand persons at Magnesia, a city eight hours from Smyrna, on the high road between it and the capital. Smyrna escaped. As if to test contagion, to prove its dependence on atmospheric influences, a company of Smyrniote Jews went to Magnesia to speculate in the clothes of the victims. They purchased a lot, brought them with them, and sold them in the bazaars : still Smyrna escaped. The miasma could not apparently traverse Mount Sypelas. Two evils thus appear to flow from quarantine : first, it keeps us in ignorance of the nature of plague ; secondly, it produces an alarming de moralisation. At the same time, it falls short of

To-day we could have given the monster a better reception, but were not fortunate enough to find the least trace of him. Nothing was to be had but the usual perdrix rouges, hares, and jackals. We had now before us only a moderate distance to the mountain peak, the second in height in the chain, but which from its favour able position presents the finest prospects. It is a round, rough, indented granite rock, over looking the two great plains which stretch in a semicircle from sea to sea, with mountain above mountain in the background, and the lake Elfzara in the midst, having a circum ference of ten leagues ; I could see quite plainly from this height the sea of flowers in which I had galloped about a few days before. What a pity that death should lurk beneath the rich flowery veil which distinguishes Bona perhaps from all Africa ; for it is precisely the dampness and extreme fertility of soil which pro duce the one, that too often produce the other. In the warm summer months the half of the garrison is often lying in hospital; many of whom never leave it, and others carry away the effects of disease or the germ of future death. It is very singular that, before the time of the

In the direction of Constantine, which is only thirty leagues hence, but which, on account of the faithless and blood-thirsty character of the present Bey, a traveller cannot visit, we observed a strangely-shaped mountain, with four humps like those of a camel ; and, further on to the right, two peaks which appear like regular pyramids. Towards Algiers lies the Cap de ser, with its finely-formed rock, Collo, the Cape Bugaroni, and the Bay of Stora. In the vicinity of the first cape it is thought that the Romans possessed iron-works, and it is pro bable that at that time the greater part of these mountains was covered with oak forests such as we saw to-day. As they have been burnt for fuel, and no fresh plantations made, they have gradually disappeared, in the same manner in which Ire land has been deprived of its forests in former times by the cruel neglect ofthe English.

Formerly when a malefactor was convicted, he was sentenced to a fine of dates, rice, or other productions of the country ; but Mr. Wil kinson says, that the peace of the district is now maintained by four or five hundred armed men, and by a general fine of two hundred dollars for every native killed in dispute or on any other occasion within its limits, and by an impost of double that sum for the murder of a stranger. Formerly the Arabs of the desert raised con tributions on the inhabitants of the Oasis ; but since 1813 the country has been under the dominion of the Pasha of Egypt. Ths region, comprising el Hayz and el Ferafreh as de pendants upon it, paid when M. Cailliaud was there an annual tribute of two thousand Spanish piasters; but according to Mr. Wilkinson the tribute is now raised to twenty thousand reals, or about 643/. sterling. The most imposing ruin in the Oasis Parva is a triumDhal arch, evidently Roman. It stands on a platform, 33 ft. in height above the level of Q

Two are ingenious and merit notice. The first proposal rested upon the neutralising vir tue of carbonic acid gas ; it was, that a series of lime-kilns should be forthwith constructed upon the opposite shore of the Bulloms for some miles ; a highly useful plan, excepting that no limestone or coal occurs in that part of the world, calcined sea-shells being the substitute for lime. A second projector considered these pastiles cumbrous ; and deemed a mere wall in their stead, of thirty feet in height and sixteen or twenty miles in length, a sufficient stumbling-block to the travel ling miasma ; creeping, as it does, assas sin-like, close to the earth. As the savage and independent Bulloms, however, might not desire their territories to be walled in like a nobleman's park, and their ma licious chief, rather than detain the in fectious air, would rejoice in facilitating

I am inclined to think that the decrease in the mortality arose more from the survivors being seasoned to the climate, than from any decrease of the poisonous miasma. The Fantees, as well as the Ashantees, ma nufacture gold into a variety of beautiful trin kets : their chains especially are highly valued, in consequence of the purity of the metal. Mr. M'Lean showed me an Ashantee " cable-laid" chain of the most perfect manufacture, and a snuff-box which a native had made, that, with the exception of the hinges, would not have disgraced a London artist. The usual way of getting a ring or any article made, is to weigh out the gold dust to the workman, who returns with the article completed, being less in weight by one fifth, which repays him for his workman ship and waste of metal. The quantity of gold produced on the Gold Coast varies from forty thousand to fifty thou sand ounces, and is all collected by washing.

Fernando Po has one advantage over any other situation upon the coast : its elevation is so great, that any climate may be obtained there, and an hospital might be established above the fever-level. In fact, Colonel Nicolls had cut a road up the mountain, and built a small house above the fever-range ; and I had the pleasure of seeing at Calebar, Mr. Ballard, a gentleman who was carried up in a hammock, in the last stage of fever, and had recovered immediately. The fact that marsh-fever does not exist above a cer tain level (I believe three thousand feet above the sea) is well known ; and as all African fevers are varieties produced by marsh miasma, Fernan do Po may be said to have been placed by Nature in its present position as the natural hospital for the low and marshy shores of the main land. The native population of Fernando Po may be about five thousand, divided into tribes, that were for merly constantly at war with each other; but

Let him, therefore, who values health — ay, life — fly from every part of the country where he finds them to exist in numbers ; and, not less so, the vicinity of the salt-marshes, whose miasmata cause a somnolency impossible to resist : and only one night's exposure to their deleterious ef fects, while sleeping at Perecop, gave me a sore throat, notwithstanding I adopted every pre caution to insure my safety, added to long expe rience, and a robust frame, which had already weathered the burning heats and poisonous vapours of so many climes. ; Indeed, to say the truth, such is the dangerous nature of the climate, and the frequency of ser vers, during the summer months, throughout the whole peninsula, whether on the steppe, the secluded valley, or the mountains of the south coast, that it is almost impossible for the stranger to avoid them. If you venture out to enjoy the evening breeze without being wrapped up in a mantle, or indulge, during the scorching heat of day, in the most trivial neglect of clothing, a fever is certain to ensue. The English em ployed by Count Worrenzow on the south coast, the most salubrious district in the whole country, assured me that even there they suffer, in a greater or less degree, every year, from the in-

But it is their darkened bodies, covered with mud, and cadaverous countenances, that realize every idea you might form of the resurrection of the dead. The Tartars, whose occupation is principally pastoral, are exceedingly poor in this part ofthe Crimea steppe; and, when we regard their houses, it is impossible not to think that they have stu died the art of architecture under badgers and rabbits ; for, like them, their dwellings are bur rowed into the earth. In this, however, a sin gular instinct of self-preservation is visible, de rived, probably, from observation and experience; for, while they are seldom or never attacked by intermittent fevers, the colonists who live above the earth, in fine houses, are frequently its vic tims ; the miasma being supposed, like every other, only active a few feet from the surface of the earth. While wandering in the vicinity of the Putrid Sea and the Sea of Azov, the most insalubrious part of the Crimea, I had an opportunity of as certaining that this opinion was correct, as I

Caucasian provinces, long her subjects ; for even the temptation of a dollar a-day, offered by Russia, has proved ineffectual to draw a single na tive of Circassia from the land of his forefathers. If a Circassian has to complain of the pre datory habits of his neighbours, yet, on the whole, he is considerably the gainer ; for the Tchernemorsky, in his migration from the Dnieper, brought with him the domestic habits, comfort, and cleanliness, of Europeans, together with an improved system of warfare, all of which he has taught the wild Circassian, who has thus become too formidable a foe for Russia to sub jugate. On the other hand, the Cossacks, exposed to the influence of an unhealthy climate, the poisonous miasma of the swamps, and the un tiring hostility of their enemies, are daily de creasing in numbers ; for, at present, they cannot bring more than twelve thousand men into the field, whereas, when they first settled on the Kouban, their force consisted of fifty thousand. This diminution is also attributable, in no incon siderable degree, to the late wars with Poland, in which, it is well known, they suffered most fearfully. At all events, you may be assured that no Emperor of Russia can now threaten Great Britain, as did Paul of glorious memory, with marching a hundred thousand Cossacks,

Poor Pallas, a truly estimable man, was but ill rewarded in his old days for his subserviency to the views of Catherine ; who, instead of call ing him to honours and emolument, as a just recompense for his long and faithful services, sent him to reside in the Crimea. To be sure, it was in the terrestrial paradise his own inflated descriptions had pictured : that did not, how ever, save him from falling a victim to the miasma of his Elysium. Even Dr. Clarke himself, one of the most accurate travellers of his day, was led into the same error respecting the Circassians, influ enced, no doubt, by the misrepresentations of the Don and Tchernemorsky Cossacks, with whom he was on friendly terms, and also by the disappointment he must have felt in not being permitted by the mountaineers to penetrate into

In the evening, certain vapours rising from the sea, made me believe that it was the land which I saw at the distance of one, two, or three miles. I ima gined that I could distinguish trees in great numbers, and even cattle. Looking at this land and wishing to learn its name and what towns it contained, I ad dressed myself to a Dutch pilot, married in Doublin (Dublin), who undeceived me, and made the fol lowing remarks to me. " You are not the first who has erred in the supposition of these things ; the most expert navigators are often deceived by them.

The plague, however, is occasionaily imported from Constantinople, and in 1812 its ravages were great. About the same time the natives were ha rassed by a flight of locusts, so numerous that they darkened the sky and devoured every green thing. They came from the east by gradual approaches, and were expected at Odessa long before they arrived ; their stay was short, but the havoc committed was great ; and, moreover, it was perpetuated ; for they left in the ground their eggs, which were hatched the following season, when young locusts appeared in myriads, devastating every Held and tree. These remained one year more and then departed, nor have they since return ed. The noise of their wings in flying is like that of the waves of the sea, or, in the poeti cal imagery of scripture, " like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble."* We were informed that they some times fight furiously, and that the slaughtered are eaten by their conquerors. *Joelii.5.

The road runs for two hours along this morass and scarcely emerges from it when signs of cultivation are perceived within an hour of Marmora. The ground for many miles is co vered with large pieces of quartz, schist, and marbles of various colors, the great abundance and numerous strata of which have given its name to the town, in like manner as the island in the Propontis is indebted for its designation to a similar circumstance. Marmora stands picturesquely on the accli vity of a high hill, occupying a position not unlike that of Philadelphia, and surrounded by fragments of pillars and ancient buildings scattered about in profusion. It contains Ave hundred houses, of which Afty belong to Greeks, who have a miserable church sunk considerably below the level of the ground, and a priest who can scarcely read.

But, while referring to this as the hrst grand cause, he will trace as secondary agents the large quantity of salt in the soil, the sul phureous exhalations of the lake of Sodom, and the vast masses of masonry that abound throughout the plain. The impediment to a free passage of subterranean streams, offered by the substructions of cities whose names have perished with them, gives rise here, as at Athens and in the vicinity of other ruins, to a miasma which generates and perpetuates disease. It seldom happens that an European sleeps in the neighbourhood with impunity. The tent we occupied had been the property of an English man whose enterprising spirit led him to visit this untravelled region the preceding year ; but he had scarcely succeeded in launching a boat on the Dead Sea, when he caught a fever and died. One of our party also suffered se verely from his visit to this land of death, and nearly two months elapsed before he recovered from a similar attack. Of Jericho what shall I say ? How fallen is " the city of palm trees !"* We saw but one, and that of a degenerate species.

The surrounding country is particularly luxuriant ; and in the early history of Terceira, when the cultivation of tobacco and the sugar cane was encouraged, rendered Praya a comparatively wealthy, thriving place ; but it is now calamitously reduced, its sickly inhabitants living almost in indolence. It assumed, at the time I refer to, a more than usual air of gaiety and activity in consequence of the British corps of marines belonging to the expedition being quartered there ; and the Admiral took this opportunity of passing them in review with Colonel Hodges, who, prompted by Major Williams, put them through the different movements to exhibit their improved condition ; which really, when one recollected their raggamuffin, undisciplined character but a few weeks previous, reflected the greatest pos sible credit on any man who could thus reduce them to ready obedience, and model them from clodhoppers and artisans to a steady controllable military body.

To escape them I went on dedk, but even there the smell of tobacco, with the suffocating miasma arising from below, totally destroyed the refresh ing quality of the air. At this moment, a boat, such as is commonly attached by a rope to larger vessels, caught my eye, and, tempted to enjoy the morning air in all its freshness, after a short moment of hesitation, I jumped into it, and was delighted at being enabled to breathe freely. I remained there sitting quietly for some time, not the slightest idea of danger occurring to my mind, until I perceived that the boat was at some distance from the vessel, and was gra dually drifting away. As it was tied with a rope, it could hot be loosened at once, and in so far I thought I was safe. Still, seeing it in a moment drift rapidly to a considerable distance, a nervous terror came over me. It appeared as if really I was completely losing hold of the vessel, and was abandoned to the capricious waves. At one moment, however, the boat approached

With disease and misery, indus try still more rapidly decays, and if the process goes on, it seems that Italy wib soon be ready for another experiment of colonisation. " Yet once it was not so, when Italy was possessed by the masters of slaves ; when Rome contained her mibions, and Italy was a garden ; when their fron energies of body corresponded with the energies of mind, which made them conquerors in every climate, and on every sob ; rolled the tide of conquest, not, as in later times, from the south to the north ; extended then- laws and civilisation, and created them lords of the earth.

Many causes, no doubt, have concurred ; but though ""War, famine, pestilence, and flood and fire, Have dealt upon the seven-hilled city's pride,'1 I wib venture to say that nothing has dealt upon it more heavily than the loss of domestic slavery.

Mattrasses are rare things in India, and feather beds unknown, the general substitute being a lace-work of stout tape stretched on the bed frame, with a quilt over it. Every bed has its mosquito curtains, composed of thin gauze, which is useful in keeping off insects, in moderating the current of wind when sleeping with open doors, affording protection against damp, and even against miasma, when that exists, and no one should pass through a feverish belt of jungle without being encaged in mosquito gauze. In violent fevers great relief is got by lying in bed corpore nudo. At formal parties one is expected to appear in cloth, but that is generally made of so light material as not to be oppressive, unless on very great oc casions. Full dress uniform is now rarely worn, indeed, uniform of all sorts is seldom seen off duty7, a great improvement upon the old pipeclay and martinet system.

Miasma loses its property of producing fever in its progress on the wind, as if it became too volatile to have effect. Localities within one mde of a marsh may be feverish, whereas others five miles distant may be healthy. People born and bred in a malarial country become inured to it, and enjoy comparatively good health, where new comers would suffer. The Garrows, one of the hill tribes, on the frontier of Assam, are the most powerful, athletic race I have seen in India, yet they inhabit a country, into the interior of which no European could penetrate without the certainty of a most dangerous fever. In some parts of South America, a slave escapes from bondage, and finds a safe asylum in some well- known deadly jungle, knowing that his master would follow him thither at the risk of his life. Landholders frequently take advantage of their being seasoned to marshy situations, rent ing their farms at a very low rate, when a succes sion of casualties to new coiners has prevented people in general from having anything to do with such supposed unlucky spots. In most cantonments in India, there are certain marked houses, known from their unhealthiness, and waste ; or only occupied for a month or two

TANKS, POOLS AND DRAINS.-But marshes and rice fields are but two of the many sources of disease to be seen on every hand in India. Every native of rank has a nursery for fever in the immediate vicinity of his house caUed a tank, and every poor man a pool, from which he dug the mud to build his house, which seem as if made on purpose to supply them with malaria, as well as with muddy water. I do not mean to attribute any blame to tanks and ponds, if kept properly clean, they would then be both useful and orna- mental, and the sod excavated in forming them would serve to raise the adjoining land and render it dry; but from the weeds and jungle that in most cases are allowed to infest them, they exert the most prejudicial effects on the health of the inhabitants. If the ditches of Fort WiUiam were allowed to remain filled with stagnant water, and become a field for the study of reeds and rushes, its present healthy character would soon leave it, and were the numerous tanks throughout Calcutta left to nature, the consequences on the public health would be calamitous. Things are bad enough as they are. Calcutta is probably the worst drained city in the British dominions ; its present drains are nothing better

As an icicle of that " beautiful fabric of frost- work" in the " melting mood," I regret that the especial reporter did not come among us, or at least take post between the groups of' contiguous columns standing at attention for two or three hours under that glorious sun, ankle-deep in poached mire and water. Then, while he in- haled the marsh miasma and pestiferous exhala- tion from animal and vegetable matter around, he could have taken note of the numbers of men that fell fainting in the ranks, or of those who stooped down and sipped the puddle water at their feet. He could also have read strange language in the faces of the officers and the men, depressed by gloomy and melancholy forebodings ; the sum and substance of that dead weight being, that they were to be disbanded, and this was their last field day— that, after all their up-hill work, and sacrifices of all sorts, they were to be inglo riously snuffed out, dismissed, sent to the right-

They clamoured to be permitted to land in vain ; they clamoured for more water, and before sunset fever broke out among them. Some of these stricken poor wretches were laid upon the upper deck, and tended by one or two of their comrades. Fortunately, we had lemons on board, and medical men; but it was an ill-judged act to keep those unhappy men two days and two nights on board a transport in such an unhealthy spot, breathing miasma, and crowded together under the rays of a July sun, gasping for air and water. One of the beauties of the port consists in the protecting position of the hills around it, which exclude every breath of air or capful of wind, save the faint whiffs that may effect an entrance at the upper end of the harbour, vid the marsh and its Aceldama. I turned into my berth with anything but plea surable feelings. I felt disappointed, depressed ; and a fit of cold shivering warned me to commence with the quinine directly, if I meant to stave off an attack of fever. They had a Kertch piano (a prize, of course) on board a transport next to ours, upon which some musical genius, with a very heavy hand, hammered away at the Edinburgh Qua-

The energy of early youth had bid defiance to the enemy. Nor are such instances uncommon in Mingrelia, even in the most insalubrious localities, but the influence of the climate is generally discernible in men of twenty years of age. Our first visit was to the strand, where I en joyed, once more the majestic spectacle of a storm on the Euxine. So soon as the rain had ceased, and the black tempest had made way for a white squall — the name given to cloudless hurricanes on the Black Sea, I made excursions to the Convent of Chopi, at the mouth of the Phasis to Sugdidi, the residence of the Dadian family, and to the Monastery of Martwili.

The feudal system is still in force there, with its most odious features, and the little that escapes the rapacity of the Lord, is eaten up by Cos sacks, employe's, and a host of Russian locusts. There exists four classes in the population, as in Circassia. First, the Dadian, or king, who acknowledged the Russian supremacy in 1804, and who enjoys absolute power save in matters of life and death. Next come the princes, who have considerable landed property, and are oc casionally refractory. The remainder of the land belongs to the petty nobility, who can grind the peasant with impunity. The only difference between the condition of Mingrelian and Russian serfs, is, that the former has more method, and a traditional system of much older date. This system is some security, as no Colchian dreams of violating conservative usage. Thus a peasant who is required to plough for his lord would refuse to thrash or make hay for him. But they accomplish their traditional duties without a murmur. On the other hand, it would be imprudent to impose new services, as the mountains and frontiers are at hand for a

I am having all our letters of recommendation for the interior copied, to be sent home to Govern ment, so that if anything happen to us they may know what kind of support we have received. If anything happen ! The presence of that doubt gives a solemnity and an importance to the most trifling thing we do. A soldier is allowed to indulge in serious thought before going into battle, and the chances in his favour are greater than those in ours. We, too, may have to do battle with men ; but the dangers of the desert are also arrayed against us, and when they are passed, the miasmas of Central Africa fill the air beyond. The marabout, with his camel and burden, has not yet come up ; he left us to visit his country. We are likewise still without news of three cainel loads left behind at Mizdah. There is always a train of stragglers behind every caravan that is not huddled together by fear. We should never have procured beasts enough on the road, and did well to take them direct from Tripoli. The Pasha's circular letter was of little or no use in this respect; and, indeed, we could not expect it to cause camels to start out of the ground. 8th. — I paid a visit to the commandant of the troops, Runthar Aga, Bim Bashaw, quite a Chris tian Moor ; and got information on military affairs whilst tasting the soup in the kitchen.

Thus all the rotten wood, dead leaves, and putrid vegetation brought down by the torrent during the wet season, are left upon the dried bed to infect the air with miasma. This deadly climate would be an insurmountable obstacle to the success of estates. Even could managers be found to brave the danger, one season of sickness and death among the coolies would give the estate a name which would deprive it of all future supplies of labour. Indigo is indigenous to Ceylon ; but it is of an inferior quality, and an experiment made in its cultivation was a total failure. In fact, nothing will permanently succeed in Ceylon soil without abundance of manure, with the exception of cinnamon and cocoa-nuts. Even the native gardens will not produce a tolerable sample of the common sweet potato without manure, a positive proof of the general poverty of the soil. Nevertheless, Ceylon has had a character for fertility. Bennett, in his work entitled " Ceylon and its Capabilities," describes the island in the most florid terms, as "the most important and valuable of all the insular possessions of the im-

Her schools have multiplied, till fifty-three are open for the education of her twenty-three hun dred children, besides three academies for the higher branches of instruction, and a normal school to give completeness to the system. And if, in addition to these, we seek to measure the results of her manufacturing and mechanical industry, the statistics just published by the Legisla ture exhibit an aggregate of more than two million of dollars by the year. There may be richer communities, there may be regions where Nature has been more lavish in her beauties and her bounty, there may be localities bet ter known to fame, than that where we are now assembled ; but where need we look for more certain elements of social and individual comfort and inde pendence and happiness than are shared upon this portion of the heritage of a free people] If, compared with some regions of ripe fertility, its soil be hardy, it breeds no miasma to paralyze or poison the arm that tills it. If the breeze that sweeps over it be at times piercing and chill, it brings no pestilence in its train to blanch the ruddy glow of health.

Altogether Saratov left a favourable impression, resembling Moscow in miniature. Everything was to be obtained, and generally at a moderate rate. Im portant provincial town as this is, however, we searched in vain for a map of Russia ; indeed, where anything is required connected with instruction or education, a sad falling off is found in all Russian towns. We replenished our stock of English porter, at ten rubles, thirty kopecs the dozen, or about two shillings and tenpence a bottle ; an extravagant price, but which was not to be thought of when its beneficial influence in supporting the physical powers was taken into consideration. There is no doubt that good living enables the system of persons unaccustomed to the climate, to resist the influence of the miasma of the Volga, which produces intermittent fever. In our case it was necessary to take all the precautions possible, as, in consequence of our cabin having been so indif ferently built, we were almost as much exposed as though we had slept in the opei air. We lived quite luxuriously, obtaining beef and mutton at a fraction more than a penny a pound, chickens at threepence or fourpence each, and the richest milk at a penny a quart.

Of course' as new streets are opened in that direction, the nuisance will gradually disappear. Nothing, howr ever, but the extension of the town to the base of the surrounding hills, from Sans Souci to the Four a Chaux, will effectually eradicate the evil, and it will require ages of improvement to produce that result. Castries possesses a Place d'Armes, or square, 336 feet from east to west, and 292 from north to south. To that active Governor, Sir Dudley Hill, this square is indebted for much of its importance. He it was who planted its ornamental trees ; re moved the old Court House (an eye-sore that formerly stood in the centre) ; and thence trans ferred the market to its present advantageous and more suitable position at the north-west corner of the wharf. Two officers, styled "Town Wardens," are ap pointed to enforce the regulations as to cleanliness, and superintend tbe reparation of the pavements, the removal of all obstructions from the wharves, and of all buildings in a state of decay.

The site of this church appears to have been se lected without any regard to health or convenience. If Colonel Farquharson had been commissioned to devise the best means of checking the growth of Protestantism in St. Lucia, he could not have succeeded more effectually, than by erecting the church in the heart of a swamp. Nor is this all : owing to its distance from the houses of the respectable inhabitants, they are compelled to traverse the town under a broiling sun, and the state of fatigue and perspiration in wThich they reach the church, must predispose them to inhale more of the poison of miasma from the surrounding atmosphere, than of the spirit of God's holy word. Finally, in 1834, as if to put a climax to the infection of this locality, the Protestants, discontinuing their former com mendable usage of interring their co-religionists side by side with their Catholic neighbours, com menced the formation of a cemetery for them selves within four yards of the church.

Where in the whole world again, is there a church, except our own glorious, protestant St. Paul's, which ' The clouds must claim' ? Other churches, indeed, they may claim, if they will; but this they must claim, whether they will or not. That's the peculiar feature, the grand characteristic mark, by which this church is distinguished from all the churches that ever have been, or ever will be, in the world ; the clouds must claim it. The clouds themselves I say, not that dim, dun, dark, dirty, dis mal, stinking, stifling, chemical compound of smoke, and damp, and mist, and miasma, known by the sou briquet of London fog, which hides the noble fabric from your view six days out of every seven, but the pure, bright, buoyant, etherial, fleecy clouds them selves ; they must claim it. Whether they will get it or not, is another matter ; one about which, de pending as it does wholly on the decision ofthe pre liminary question, whether it does or does not belong to the category of castles in the air, the poet has most

Often of a moonlight night, when the rioting of these birds, coupled with the stifling closeness of the atmosphere, had effectually driven sleep from my pillow, have I sat for hours at this window, and meditated on the dreary landscape before me. Heaps upon heaps of crumbling ruins were there, with desolate sand hills, thinly interspersed with stunted palms, thorn trees and branches, thistles and noxious weeds ! All shrubs that flowered sweetly, all trees yielding luscious fruits — birds bright in plumage and rare in song — the brighter and richer gifts of nature were, alas ! no longer extant. " Gaza shall be forsaken,"* was the direful denunciation of the Prophet Zachariah, and most fearfully has this prophecy been fulfilled. The new Lazaretto and quarantine establish ment at Gaza are eligibly situated on a plain, about three hours distant from the Egyptian frontiers, commanding an extensive view of the surrounding country and high roads, and suffi ciently distant from the town to be free from its local miasma, without suffering inconveni- * Zachariah, ii, 4.

As I mentioned before, the town of Jaffa is built up the sides of a hill. This hill is in a conical form, and the ascent and descent approxi mates to the perpendicular. The streets are vile in the extreme and very slippery in the summer, owing to the water and other slops thrown out of the windows. In the winter the torrents of rain water that rush down, entirely sweep away this layer of abominations, and leave a hard dry soil to walk upon. I was in danger of shpping every instant, and only saved myself by clinging tightly to the stones of the buildings which, not being plastered over, were easily grasped. If you do slip, the only thing that can bring you up is the sharp angle of some gloomy wall. I at last found myself in the main street of

This spot may be considered the greatest nuisance in the place ; for the miasma arising from the accumu lated filth of some hundreds of camels and mules, packed in a very limited space, is frightful beyond conception. To the right is the native Khan or Caffine, devoted to the use of indigent native travellers. Beyond, are a couple of granaries, with a broken wall intervening, over which you may scramble, if you are sure-footed, into the garden of the Greek casino ; but there is a deep wed on one side, and an empty pit on the other, into one or the other of which you are sure to pitch, if you lose your balance. To the left there is another granary, and beyond, the wads of the town, and the Acre gate. This gate is shut at night and opened at sunrise, ostensibly for the security of Caipha, and is guarded by a sleepy soldier, in very rusty accoutrements, who labours under the delusion that he is rendering great service to the State and to the Sultan, by never letting any one in or out of the gate after or before the proper hour, the fact having never entered his

At the village of Bogatitsh we pulled up at the door of a wine-shop, in which about twenty Serbian peasants were seated round a fire. " Buyurun ! " one of them exclaimed, taking us all for Turks, and seeing the water dripping from our cloaks. We dismounted ; three of them ran out to take care of our horses ; the remainder made room for us by the fire, and received us with a degree of friendliness which, as a Turk, I hardly expected to experience from the Serbs. After steaming ourselves like boiled potatoes, for we coidd not dry so rapidly, we mounted again in half an hour, and continued our west ward course. The village of Tshernabara did not tempt us to stop, and we pushed on to Racsa, which we reached at nightfall. This is the quarantine station on the river Drina, which divides the province of Serbia from that of Bosnia : it is situated near the confluence of that stream with the Save, and opposite the Austrian fort. There is a khan, a lazaretto, and some mills, surrounded by a meadow forming a sort of lawn, diversified by noble trees, and no village nearer than Tshernabara. It is said to be so infested by musquitos and marsh miasma, as to render it almost uninhabitable, — a philanthropic institution for a quarantine establishment ! To keep out the plague, which does not exist, people are kept here to waste away by fever, or to be eaten, body whole, by enormous musquitos,

Except from the excessive heat, I can see no reason for the unhealthiness of La Guayra, as there are no mangrove swamps nor any thing to produce miasma in the surrounding country. We landed in the evening, and with some difficulty passed our traps through the Custom-house, and made arrangements for sending them up to the city of Caraccas that night, intending to ride up the next morning. The bay of La Guayra is infested with sharks ; hut, singular enough, they never attack a human being ; and the negroes and mulattoes that are em ployed to load and unload the vessels, swim and wade about with perfect impunity. The La Guayrans say, that one of the first Roman Catholic bishops that arrived from Spain was upset in the bay ; and to reward the sharks for having respected one of the dignitaries of the Church, he gave them his blessing, and since that time they have never injured a true Catholic ; but if a heretic, like one of ourselves, had fallen in, the sharks would have discovered the dif ference in a moment. We spent the evening with a Spanish merchant and his very pretty Spanish wife. We heard a good deal about the recently discovered gold fields of Apaca, near Angostura, on the Orinoco. The gold is discovered in great plenty ; but the climate is so fatal to Europeans, that all who had gone to gather wealth, had lost that much more valuable commodity, health.

A glance at the position of the peninsula on a map will suffice to perceive the striking difference between the outlines of the sea and of the lake. The putrid lake, whose waves sink powerless upon a low beach, exhibits, in the outline of its shores, a thousand fan tastic and varying contortions. The Black Sea, on the contrary, lying in a deep bed, presents a steady and more even hne of coast. Perecop is inhabited chiefly by the servants of the government and by a great number of Jews, who abandon themselves with delight to all their native uncleanliness. We should be much astonished to be told that this was one of the most commendable situations in a sanitary point of view. The viscous sea lying so close to the vdlage, constantly heated to the very bottom of its slimy bed, gives forth, according to certain travellers, a miasma, injurious to the quality of the surrounding atmosphere. In the inestimable work of M. Montandon, already quoted by us, we find, however, a contrary opinion expressed. This writer points out Perecop as a particularly healthy spot, in the teeth of all contrary prejudice. That which is certainly true, without entering into a discussion as to its deleterious effects, is, that this putrid sea is, for the whole of this country, a great source of trade and movement.

The road is a very good bridle-path, but no carts could, in the very wildest imagination, be taken an inch of this dence, for within a week both mother and daughter died of the jungle-fever.

There are three distinct ranges, of much the same elevation, but presenting very varying fea tures in the grouping as well as the general aspect. The table-land on the summits is much undulated, and swamps, free from miasma, are found in the vadeys. Dodabet Beak forms the due of separation between the north-east and south-west monsoons, ad the mountains to the west of the peak being subject to the influence of the latter. A belt of dense jungle completely environs the base of the hills, rising from 2,000 to 3,000 feet along their declivities. This belt is of varying breadth — nowhere less than six mdes in extent, and nowhere exceeding twenty. After the belt of jungle is surmounted, there occurs ordinarily a line of demarcation (an open space nearly destitute of trees) above which the Alpine character of the vegetation and forest begins to be distinctly observable, and the jungly under wood almost entirely disappears, rich grass taking its place.

No doubt, on the subsiding of the waters, that is, during the summer, an unhealthy miasma will invade its precincts. Yet this will not deter thousands from occupying this position, nor will there be any want of persons to supply the places of those who may succumb to its effects; for a species of Californian yellow fever, which rages in parts of the United States, never abates in con sequence of the innovations of any other ; and thus Cairo, though now insignificant, may in a few years excel, both in wealth and in size, as it speedily will in intelligence, its older namesake Cairo on the Nile, whose propensities to overflow her banks are the same as the Mississippi. Another cause, I was informed, which has retarded Cairo, was, that the company, following the English custom, declined to sell the lots, and were only willing to let them on long leases. When so much land and city lots are in the market, property under these restrictions will rarely attract purchasers ; but now that they are to be for bond fide sale, no doubt they will find purchasers. Notwithstanding the assertions of the clerk of

The sun, acting upon a soil so impregnated with moisture, must naturally cause a great miasma and unhealthy effluvia, which, during the summer season, must probably be the cause of a vast amount of the sickness which exists, and which gives to this city the unenviable character of being the most un healthy in the world. During the hot season, all who can afford to do so fly from its precincts into the country, and business at that time is almost at a stand-still. The shell roads which enter the city in various directions, are certainly the most beautiful cause ways I have ever seen. They arc composed of finely-powdered shells, which, uniting in a solid mass, form a perfectly even surface, and may be considered one of the peculiarities of this town. As I was returning to the hotel I saw a melancholy breed of dogs, their skins being entirely devoid of hair : this certainly did not improve their outward appearance, though I have no doubt that, in the warm weather, it might be a source of comfort to

Few in Russia accord to Kakoshkine that skill in his peculiar occupation attributed to him by his master ; but if far from possessing the ingenuity of Vidocq, he is universally considered as ranking many degrees below him in infamy of character. Prince Tchornichef must not be classed with these men — the vermin of a profoundly demoralised society, — who would never have been admitted into the society of his valet, if not refracting, as they do, the light of imperial favour ; which, in Russia, like the rays of the sun, raises the miasma of filth and corruption to an offensive altitude in the social atmosphere. Prince Tchornichef, a man of courtly habits and manners, recalls the noble of the reign of Charles the II. or Louis the XV., — or perhaps rather of an antecedent period, less profligate, though more ruthlessly unscrupulous, — but he has nothing in common, except a share of his sovereign's confi dence, with the two other individuals cited, who can only be compared to those slaves who by pan dering to the caprice of their tyrants, rise in the east from menial servitude to power.

The medical profession is, generally speaking, an unprofitable one; there are no endemic diseases, fevers or agues; the dry, warm and elastic atmosphere is, besides, peculiarly favourable to asthmatic and pulmonary complaints ; I have myself known cases where the early stages of these dis eases have been removed, and in many others great and permanent relief afforded, where the disease was too deeply rooted for a radical cure ; people, who, before they left England, were for years in a debilitated state of health, some, that were actually given over as hopeless cases, have on arriving in South Australia taken out an entirely " new lease," and are now as hearty, hale, and strong, as they could wish, able to undergo fatigues of all sorts, and exposure to heat, cold, and "bushing it" under a gum tree, with a saddle for a pillow, without the least inconvenience. The following testimony to the salubrity of our climate is from our colonial surgeon, and is the result of seven years experience: " I have much pleasure in being able to state, as the result of nearly seven years' experience, that there is not a more healthy climate in the world than that of South Australia.

The canal upon which Horace embarked on his celebrated journey to Brundusium, runs parallel with the road for its whole distance. This marshy desert is inhabited by a race of as wretched beings, perhaps, as are to be found upon the face of the earth. The pestiferous miasma of the pools is certain destruction to health ; and the few who are needed at the distant post-houses, crawl out to the road-side like so many victims from a pest-house, stooping with weakness, hollow-eyed, and appa rently insensible to every thing. The feathered race seems exempt from its influence, and the quantities of game of every known description are incredible. The ground was alive with wild-geese, turkeys, pigeons, plover, ducks, and numerous birds we did not know, as far as the eye could distinguish. The travelling-books caution against sleeping in the carriage while passing these marshes, but we found it next to impossible to resist the heavy drowsiness of the air.

The soil, like that of Illinois generally, is better suited to the grazier than the agriculturist. It is composed of a black and rich mould, with a small admixture of fine silicious sand, and rests on soft and permeable clay without being interspersed with stone or gravel. This formation, while it is unfavourable to the existence of perennial streams and fountains, and impedes the plough of the agriculturist, and endangers his health by the creation of miasma, yet in the vicinity of the middle lands furnishes inexhausti- ble meadows to the grazier, and every facility for canals and railroads. The Illinois River was de- scribed by General G. B. Clark so long ago as 1777, as " a natural canal passing through natural meadows;" and the facility with which branches might be made as the country requires them is now very apparent. The route of the proposed canal (of which I have before spoken), to connect the waters of Lake Superior with those of the Gulf of Mexico, by a communication of only one hundred miles, commences at a point on the Chi cago River, five miles above its mouth, where the water is twelve feet deep, and on a level with Lake Michigan ; thence seven miles and a half to the

The circulation of air is impeded, the weeds are permitted to wither and decay upon the ground, and from these deposits, and from the swamps produced by neglected tanks, miasma is created, which threatens the visitor with disease and death.

A variety of experiments were tried by all the medical men then residing there, in the hope of discovering some effectual mode of treatment ■ but they failed in every instance, solely on account of tlie rapidity of the progress of the disease, and the danger of contact with the patient. Indeed the most enterprising of those who volunteered their services became victims of their intrepidity, and in the space of a few weeks there was hardly a physician or surgeon left to apply to in other cases of need. The first symptoms of this horrid disease are headache and nausea : high fever and delirium succeed in the course of a few hours ; and when the miasma is of a very poisonous kind the patient dies before the full developement ofthe primary symptoms. Much of this, however, de pends upon the previous habit of body and the strength of the constitution. There are some men who will endure the violence of the attack for a longer period than others, and these have always the best chance of escaping. If we may judge from the great characteristic of this disease, which is a tumor generally breaking out in the groins or under the arm-pits, we must suppose the pestilence to consist of a subtle virus, which cir culates with great activity through the system,

XVII who have not expressed themselves greatly disappointed upon these subjects, after comparing the reality of things with the descriptions that had been given of them in England. People in general however, and especially settlers who emigrated at an earlier period, who have been fortunate in the situation and quality of their land, and whose employment is in the open air, are captivated by the voluptuousness of the climate, and the freedom of the air from distempered miasma, arising from decayed vege table matter and stagnant pools. The absence of under wood secures this happy result, and leaves an open and grassy country on almost every side of them. It affords also, without previous labour, facilities for grazing flocks and herds upon the spontaneous herbage of the soil, and forms a pleasing relief to the eye under the blaze of an almost perpetual sunshine ; but, unfortunately, all these advantages, which render it so pleasant and so healthy an abode for man, are produced by causes which are also the origin of its poverty, and which I shall endeavour more particularly to explain in the body of this work. There is another feature in this remarkable country which must ever have great influence on the extent of its population and the quantity of its exportable productions, at least as far as present settlements are concerned — I mean the want of navigable waters. Nowhere has any discovery been made of a river which is navigable above twenty or twenty-five miles, and enough is now known of the coasts at very considerable distances from the present

Happy had he been if he had still remained the same humble in- dividual, immortalized by the pen of Byron.* The kula of Sadek Effendi, on the opposite side of the road, might have given Suleiman a valuable lesson if he had been disposed to receive it. Strange as the story may seem, it is a tradi tion on record, that this house has ever been fatal to the lives of those that inhabit it ; and from its elevated situation, while the low ground around it, upon which the miasma might be sup posed to rest, is not at all unhealthy. If I was not a Christian, I should say that this might arise from the anger of the Deity whose temple pre-occupied the site ; for the numerous vestiges * It is of him Lord Byron speaks in his notes to the second canto of Childe Harold, describing him as " Suleyman Aga, late governor of Athens, and now of Thebes."

The town is built, as I beheve most American towns are, in squares, as they call them ; but these squares are the reverse of our's, being sohd instead of hollow. Each consists, or is intended to con sist, when the plan of the city is completed, of a block of buildings fronting north, east, west, and south ; each house communicating with an alley, furnishing a back entrance. This plan would not be a bad one were the town properly drained, but as it is, these alleys are horrible abominations, and must, I conceive, become worse with every passing year. To the north Cincinnati is bounded by a range of forest-covered hills, sufficiently steep and rugged to prevent their being built upon, or easily culti vated, but not sufficiently high to command from their summits a view of any considerable extent. Deep and narrow water-courses, dry in summer, but bringing down heavy streams in winter, divide these hills into many separate heights, and this furnishes the only variety the landscape offers for many miles round the town.

With the exception of the palace, a large and heavy edifice, and the collection of Dutch pic tures, there is little of an individual character to attract a stranger's attention. The tout en semble is striking. An Englishman feels him self to be in a country different from his own, yet he can scarcely decide what marks most forcibly the distinction. The stagnant water and the low lands, connected, as they are in the mind, with their necessary concomitants miasma and sickness, are what most displease: unless, indeed, the traveller be annoyed, as we have been at every inn, by finding sheets on the bed from which the moisture might almost be wrung in drops. The collection of pictures to which I have just referred is the only one not removed to Paris during the reign of Napoleon. It con tains the choicest pieces of Rembrandt, Ge rard Douw, Snyder, Paul Potter, Teniers, Wouvermans, and Rubens. Among the chef d'œuvres of these artists, those that most at tracted us are an evening school by Gerard Douw, in which the varied characters and con flicting passions of the pedagogue and his boys are strikingly exhibited ; the change of a night watch by Rembrandt, Avhere the lurid and partial glare of a lamp is contrasted with the

This has been accounted for in the præ-sanitarian times by the large amount of fragrant plants consumed in heating the baths of the place ; but if the salubrity be real, and not as imaginary as the celebrated salmon with whose pro- perties King Charles is said to have puzzled the Royal Society, it is perhaps in some degree due to the fresh breeze which every day blows over the neigh- bouring lake. The streets, too, in very many instances meet overhead, and the layer of dirt with which they are lined is thus protected from the quickening influence of the sun, while the inhabitants, living in houses of which the windows open into square courts, are only exposed to the miasma of the streets when they have occasion to pass through them. At the same time, nothing can be more uncertain than the true rate of mortality in any Mahometan city. The repugnance which the Moslems feel for any shadow of interference with the privacy of their family life precludes the possibility of all accurate information. Even in Algiers the French have never ventured to enforce the registration of births and deaths among the Moorish population.

Coasting along by the mouths of the many rivers that debouch into the Gulf of Guinea, the eye of the voyager rests upon nothing more attractive than a continuation of scenes such as those described by Captain Burton in Eastern Africa, and which are sketched forth by Earl de Grey and Ripon in last year's address to the Royal Geographical Society, as of " a fever stricken country, that is skirted by a wide low lying belt of overwhelming vegetation, dank, mo notonous, and gloomy, wdiile it reeks with fetid miasma." Let us flit over the marshy grounds that border the Niger's many mouths, and leave the mangrove swamps to the oysters and crocodiles, wmilst we travel, with the progress of civilization and the development of commerce, up the Quorra to Cen tral Africa. It would be but a dish of crambe repetita to de tail all the early explorations and progresses made up this river since the discovery of its mouth by the brothers Lander in 1831.

The old clois ters that surround it are picturesque, supported by very rich Byzantine columns ; and a campanile, or tower, built about four years ago, is a very favoura ble specimen of modern Italian architecture. Within the church there is a screen, richly ornamented in the Greek fashion with gilding and pictures, and also the tomb of St. Lazarus. The saint's body is no longer here, having been transported some years ago to Venice. This is the same St. Lazarus whose grave we had so lately visited at Bethany. The women of Larnica excel in making a peculiar kind of silk lace, which is much sought after by the Greek ladies ; it somewhat resembles Irish crochet, and when worked in patterns of flowers and leaves the effect is very pretty. The climate of Cyprus is said to be the worst in the Mediterranean ; but the various Consuls we saw all assured us that, with the commonest precautions, fever may be avoided. Much of the miasma doubt less arises from the large tracts of uncultivated land ; but this, under an energetic Government, might quickly be remedied. With that dislike of change for which the Ottoman empire has always been re markable, not only do the Turkish officials here offer no encouragement to industry, but they actually dis-

The aforesaid uncleanly black having boarded us, he, in a mixture of Negro-Frencb, and worse English, informed us he was the captain of the port, one having authority, who possessed the power to permit us to land, or deny us the privilege ; and with this preamble he demanded our bill of health. This was handed him, together with a glass of grog, which was added by the advice of Buck stone, who, versed in negro character, and aware of the irresistible fascination, and the ameliorating influence that beverage possesses for the black, declared that its application invariably softens a sable heart inclined to obduracy, and must therefore subdue in this subject any tendency to asperity. Our friend's calculation did not prove un-

Then, as the river gradually narrows, the tops of some trees become discernible, but still almost obscured by a thick yellow mist, which, laden with miasma arising from the decaying vege table deposits, reeking and festering in the swamps, envelopes, and like a pall, as charac terizing the deadliness of the climate, overhangs the land. Such is the atmosphere the lieges of the island of St. Mary, and of the town of Bathurst, Gambia, are doomed to inhale,* — and what won der its climate is so deadly ! Here, too, was I, at that time, condemned to sojourn. However, as we neared the dreaded town of Bathurst the aspect much altered and improved, and the place, sparkling white and gay in the sun, built at the water's edge, on glittering silver sand, with noble-looking houses shining through a terrace of green trees, and apparently em bosomed in verdure, seemed more like a city of palaces than the place of purgatory usually re presented. We soon anchored, and at this period Chad band made his first appearance on deck since his retirement the previous evening, and now

So deadly is the climate they dare seldom venture ashore, and the only excitement they ever experience is to watch for alligators floating lazily along the stream ; to emulate with one another which shall first collect a cargo ; to scrutinize the shore through their telescopes, and when a canoe is seen putting off, to speculate whether it contains palm oil, which drops in thus slowly by gallons and puncheons, — each one, whether it is bound for his hulk or that of a rival ; the anxious hope as it approaches, and the corresponding disap pointment when it is seen dodging off to a neigh bour's hulk. Or, when socially inclined, the excitement consists in visiting each hulk at night, and instead of entering by the usual mode, to scramble in at the cabin windows, and pulling the occupant from his berth, compel him, willing or unwilling, to produce strong water, and make a night of it. Who can wonder that these wretched exiles, wearied with ennui, and de pressed by their solitary existence and the influ-

And what has been the result ? The blacks, as already shown, have suffered injury more than derived benefit. This country has aban doned its boasted principles ; has been nearly embroiled with several nations ; has lowered its colours in the Charles and George affair and the right of search ; it allows France to enlist immigrants in a manner the philanthropists wish to deny to our own colonists ; and at the present juncture, while the country is swayed by the cottonocracy, we risk a war with North America by morally supporting the South — the Slave States ;* and yet, notwithstanding all our * I would not for a moment be supposed to advocate the support of the North against the South. I merely note the fact, as illustrating the inconsistency of the conduct pursued by the British Government on this question. Every person acquainted with the late United States, must be well aware that a greater prejudice against colour exists in the North than in the South. Most of us must be aware that the South is defending itself against oppression, and that the cry of freedom to the slave, has been merely raised as political capital, and is now put forward in the hope of enlisting the sympathies of the British.

Of the Europeans, I saAV a feAV in Tamatave who were attacked every summer by the fever, though they had lived there for three or four years.

May 22. This morning we travelled three hours by water on the river Fark, which falls into the sea not far from the village Avhere we had passed the night. This river is very broad, but has few deep parts. Its banks afford a greater variety of scenery than the rivers we had hitherto seen. The uniform flats begin noAV to alternate with little clusters of hills, and ic the far background a low ridge becomes visible. Coming to a great bend in the river, we disembarked.

Mischievous and spiteful as the mist is in the hiUs, where he has already guided many a sure-footed mountaineer on the road to death, or with iU-natured pleasure has so veiled the lofty points just toisomely reached by tra veUers searching for a view, that they have had to return without gaining their object, stil, when he is in good humour, or when he leaves the heights to give a turn to the vaUeys, he can play frolicsome and jovial comedies enough. In the last case, he lays himself down far and wide over field and forest, markets and lanes, and only the mountaineer can escape from his choking miasma breathing vapours. Then the lover of nature may stand high on the free hifi-top in the golden sunshine, and look down on a waving milkwhite sea, from which the neigh bouring heights rise up ike islands ; or, as sometimes happens, when the masses have sunk very deep, the golden cross of a church tower in the vaUey shines out, soitary, symbolical, and victorious. But far down in the veied invisible vaUeys the hum of men murmurs and sounds louder than usual ; for mist is an exceUent conductor of sound upwards, though just the contrary downwards.

The dry and absorbent soil, which distinguishes almost the whole of the limestone formation, and the greater part of the gritstone formation, — assisted, as this is, by their elevated position, — must conduce much to this result, by diminishing the amount of stagnant water, and other sources of miasma tous impurity. Even the ordinary exanthematous epidemics (measles, scarlatina, and the like) are usually of singularly mild character in this district ; and typhus, and even common continued fever, rarely occurs, unless when brought into the district by persons who have been sojourning in less favoured places ; and when thus met with, has very seldom been known to have been extended to a second case. It has to be said, moreover, that no case of epidemic cholera has occurred in Buxton during any of the visitations of this fearful disease. The bearing which the high elevation of Buxton above the level of the sea, appears to have upon the probability of its exemption from cholera, is very interesting and curious. It was announced by Mr. Farr, in the admirable report on cholera for 1849, and has been since confirmed by further statistical experience, that the mortality from this dreadful malady increases as the level of places in an affected district is lower ; and not only that localities of higher level have a less liability to the disease, but that the degree of immunity may be measured by the degree of the elevation. This law must be liable to contradiction or disturbance under very powerful local exciting and predisposing circumstances, and

This difficult question comes up now to be answered : "What shall we do?" To leave the Territory is impossible ; and to me it seems like going into utter darkness to go up to that old Indian house. There we shall be four miles from neighbors, and on the Indian lands too. If they should return from their hunt and find us there, they would think we were intruding almost too much, and I know not what our fate might be. We cannot stay here without water, neither can we leave the old people four miles away, alone, to do without milk, (for it is all we have to make our food palatable.) We conclude that we must submit to the dominion of paternity, and take the result. July 3d. — The hot summer's sun of this climate is drying up the fountains of water, pouring his scorching rays upon us, unobstructed by a cloud, and visiting us with a disease that is paling almost every face, and crippling the limbs with weakness ! I am alone with my children ; my husband is getting out fencing. My Mema's chill has passed off, and she is in a raging fever. Mr. H. S. Clubb is sick with a fever. He has just passed by in a wagon ; he is being taken ten miles away upon the higher prairie ; thinks the air may be freer from miasma, and unfailing water is to be found there. Father Cosgrove and two young men are sick at Mr. Ad-

My husband has his chill and fever now in the night. I sit up with him, give him vapor baths when the chill is on, and towel baths in his fever ; he thinks he will be well in a few days ; he is sitting up, and he and father are building our log cabin in imagination. I am sorry my hope is so small — can't see why we should improve much in health at pres ent, when the air is so loaded with miasma, morn ings, that it broods over us in its density a long time, and smells as though it had just made its escape from a field of decaying cabbage. Last night our oxen came not to the house at the usual time. I watched and listened at intervals, un til it was getting late, to hear them breaking the oak brushes in their way up to the house ; but they came not. The night was long, and seemed so very still and lonely without their company. My husband felt anxious ; he feared they had gone towards the Settlement and would get into his cornfield, destroy the corn, and eat so much as to kill themselves. This morning I told, him I wanted to go to the Set tlement to see if they were there ; he told me which trail to take, to lead me to the cornfield, then I knew the way. When one mile from here I mistook, and took the wrong trail, there being so many checker ing the prairie. I walked a long way before I dis covered my mistake, then thought I must be nearly parallel with the right one, and -would keep on and

I could only succeed in bagging a few, as they were exceedingly shy, and made off as soon as the boat approached : moreover, the rushes were not thick enough to afford us an effectual concealment. As the miasma from the lake was sufficiently powerful to threaten fever, we returned to the caravanserai, where we breakfasted, and, after shooting a few quails, returned in our carriage, at one o'clock, to Bona. My driver, who sat beside me, was a very loquacious old soldier, who had served in the campaigns against the Arabs under Baraguay d'Hilliers and Youssouf, and been present at the capture of Milianah and Medeah. The Arabs, he said, never met the French fairly en bataille rangee, but always fired from ambush at the rear-guard, and in this way killed a great number of men. He described the conduct of the Arabs to their prisoners as very merciless. They never gave quarter, and frequently mutilated their captives ; the women, in this particular, being more cruel than the men. I was informed, on my return, that the party who came out last year to shoot, had only killed four lions in as many months, though they had " all appliances and means to boot," and always kept several Arabs in their pay.

Of course, I have substantial reasons for regretting this, being continually admonished by the presence of Confederate sentinels, if not by the unyielding temperament of their superiors, that it is more profitable to dream of "On to Washington !

The annual amount of importations of silk from France to the United States is estimated at 20,000,000 dollars: we want but capital, machinery, and operatives, to supersede at least two thirds of this heavy expenditure. Tennessee originally formed a part of North Carolina, and has been settled from seventy to eighty years. Its inhabitants principally consist of North and South Caroli nians and Virginians, whose names in general (with the exception of a few of those from the latter State, who are of Dutch extraction) indicate a British origin: there are a few native English, Scotch and Irish, but the isolated situation of East Tennessee has prevented the influx of Emigrants; its very existence being unknown to the majority of them. Emigration has in general been directed to New States, where men that never had an axe in their hands previously, attempt to hew down at the onset, the thickly timbered forests of the West, to rear log buildings, and undergo the hardships of a clearing and a new settlement; little do they know the hardships, the discomfits, the privations, attendant upon such a life, until located upon some of the flat and stagnant swamps of Indiana and Ulisnois, themselves and their children gradually sinking under its miasma; worn out, heart broken, and dejected; with a constitution ruined by the

The barracks for the soldiery usually kept here, are in the vicinity ; and tea gardens have recently been added. On the doAvns near Weymouth, horse or foot exercise may be enjoyed to almost any extent. The absence of wood has been thought by some a defect in the scenery ; and it cannot be denied that the general aspect of the surrounding hills is bare. But, on the other hand, this is an undoubted adA'an tage to the salubrity of the spot. One of the most frequent causes of disease in the autumnal months especially, (the season when the watering places are most frequented) is the miasma arising from de cayed vegetation. From this the neighbourhood of Weymouth is entirely free : like Brighton, Mar gate, Ramsgate, Broadstairs, Dover, and Hastings, it enjoys a dry soil, and consequently dry and healthy atmosphere, from this very circumstance. To render this more clear, it may be well to subjoin some remarks on this head, from another source, but strictly applicable to the subject under consi deration.

With the exception of this and one other portion of better land, the marshes stretch to Visp, and the thick air is impregnated with miasmas. Visp is built where the valley parts itself in two distinct branches. The one, down which rushes the torrent which gives its name to the village, leading to Monterosa ; but it is the Haneck and not Monterosa whose white mass, seen from this spot, terminates the defile of the Moro. The Visp is here broad and rapid as the Rhone, yet this place, situated near their junction, is filthy as all villages in the catholic cantons, — their united streams cannot wash the blackamoor white. After traversing the streets, our road wound grandly and perilously round the base of rocks blastedfor its formation; but this portion passed, we were again amidst the marshes, and between Visp and Glys the overflow of the Rhone has done most damage, as it is hereabouts swollen by numberless tributary streams — most tur bulent vassals. Our horses sank above the fetlock in soft mud, which covered the whole face of the valley : Indian corn and pumpkins floating on its surface. The ground floors

Only two or three desolate looking houses, with intervals of miles between, are to be seen ; these even have no oriental trace about them, but seem left as testimonies that the white man has been there, and has failed in his conflict against nature. A noontide, like " the burning fiery fur nace," chilling night fogs, and the miasma arising from putrefaction unparalleled in in tensity, gather (at Saugor) the European quickly to his grave, whilst the rapid and extreme vicissitudes from moisture to dry ness, break and crumble down his dwelling, with a rapidity unapprehended by a tarry-at home in the temperate zone. In India, every house has to undergo a thorough repair once in three years ; and before that period has half revolved, the lichen, the storm, the mon soon, "the rains," and the less apparent, but not less ruinous, secret minings of the white ant, hourly demonstrate that physical nature here has, indeed, no rest.

The bazaars, wholly inhabited by native, and chiefly Hindoo, workmen and merchants — the makers of toys and of furniture — the dealers in the costly shawls of Cashmere, and the scarfs of Delhi — the shroffs, or bankers — the slipper makers — the humble com pounders of the universally-chewed pawn — the mat weavers — the importers of all the carved and lacquered wares of China — all these are here found : a strange medley of traffickers, resident in edifices whose open fronts, contemptible size, and ruined aspect, gain little admiration from those whose ideas of a bazaar are derived from that in Soho Square, or the Burlington Arcade. The narrowness and crowded state of the streets, with their stagnant, and consequently offensive drains, seem surely prophetic of miasma and pestilence ; yet there appears to be just reason for concluding that Calcutta is annually becoming more healthy. This, no doubt, arises in a great degree, from the improved habits of the people ; but it is also occasioned by the clearing and improved

The average amount of evaporation at Calcutta during March, is seven inches ; its average temperature, according to observa tions made during a series of years, is found to be 80°, but it usually ranges between 68° at sunrise, and 82°, two hours and a half after noon. "In this month," observes Major Bruce, in his Calendar, "green peas and turnips disap pear ; salad, cabbages, carrots, and celery, are on the decline ; asparagus and potatoes good ; fish and fruit plentiful, the only novelty among the first being the small delicate gooteah. Water-melons appear, and con tinue until the middle of June ; green man goes and unripe musk-melons are in the bazaars, as are omrah and water-cresses." Two of the principal native festivals occur during this month — the Mohurrum of the Mussulmauns, and the Hooly or Dole-jattra of the Hindoos. The first is celebrated with the greatest

There are violent currents of air down the val ley, which is four leagues long, and these contri bute much to clear the atmosphere, and render this a healthy place ; which the doctors say it is in a remarkable degree. There are no stagnant waters in this neighbourhood, therefore no bad air ; for though there is a miasma surrounding the Wilden See, and not far from where the Enz takes its source, it is too high to be felt at Wildbad ; but its being surrounded by mountains makes it cold in the mornings and evenings, and in the middle of the day in summer very hot. The snow often lies in the hollows of the mountains from the month of November to the end of April ; but in the valley it soon melts with the heat of the sun, and much less falls there. The tempera ture is very variable : the thermometer fell sixteen degrees in one day this summer. The south wind, which comes from the valley of the Murg, hunts the storm down the Enz, and so little do you see of the sky, that it pours upon you before you are aware of it. This is a most interesting country to the bota nist. A great variety of plants and flowers cover the ground in every direction. In the beginning of June the Spartium Scoparium gilds your path.

How different the lux uriant revelling and midnight waste of time and health indulged in by the moderns, from the health ful pastime of the ancient Greek, enjoyed in the open day, when listening to the strains of Thucy dides or Sophocles, from the mouths of actors such as Æschylus and Aristophanes. Such comparisons, such recollections, and such excitements it is that constitute the charm and consolation of travel, and clothe with beauty every ruin of the ancients. Such are the sources of excitement which Lord Byron, who experienced them in all their power, has stated to be (next to ambition) the greatest in existence ; and he felt how sweet it was thus to sit, wrapt in the mantle of antiquity and broider the golden web that fancy weaves till the glorious tapestry of the past curtains from our view the ills and crosses of the present.

No sooner had our party appeared on the hillock, than, as if by magic, the rampart, along its wdiole circumfer ence, was gleaming with bayonets. Disease, arising from poor and bad nourishment, consisting for the most part of a black mouldy bread and a thin farinaceous soup, combining with the pestilential miasma, occasions great mortality ; to which, there is no doubt, their close confinement also materially contributes. To relieve the monotony of the latter, they make an occasional sortie, and sometimes, though very7 rarely, succeed in setting fire to the habitations, or carrying off the cattle of the Circassians, who com plain that they have no means of retaliating upon them, since the Russians have nothing but a few grunters grubbing under their guns, which,, as Mussulmans, they cannot touch. All these par ticulars were furnished us by deserters, one or more of whom are to be found in every considerable establishment in the country ; and, considering the lives they lead in garrison, it is no wonder they should be anxious to change them at any risk. So general is the disposition to desert, that it is impos sible to prevent their escape, since, in this case, quis custodiat ipsos custodes. The treatment they VOL. I. K

A residence at Semez of several months, during which we not only learnt to sympathize strongly with the hopes and fears of its inhabitants, but were associated with them in their domestic relations, frequenting their social hearths, sitting at their feasts, and attending their councils, have left all its features indelibly im pressed on my memory. Eight miles in length, two in breadth, it was divided by a forest of stately trees, sweeping down the centre, and growdng denser in its array of giant oaks as it descended almost to the beach ; for the stream which gave its name to the valley w7as there swallowed up in a swamp, producing a rank luxuriance of vegetation, and a miasma by no means conducive to the health of the inha bitants. It was, therefore, in this part, almost uninhabited ; and amidst the enormous moss grown cairns to be found in its gloomy recesses, superstition had her legends of demon-guarded treasures. But higher up the valley, where the stream was pure and unimpeded in its course, the forest had everywhere yielded to the inroads of cultivation, opening wide into sunny glades, pas tures, and cornfields, and betraying, by the smoke that curled over them, even where its ranks were thickest, the domestic oasis in its bosom. It was

In addition to the effects of the climate, so deleterious in its tendency, and the miasmas, the offspring of the marshes, the manners of the Dutch inhabitants contribute in no small degree to the frequency of febrile diseases. A siastra follows a well supplied dinner, and a heavy supper precedes the repose of night ; they also use an immensity of wine in the course of the day, and on the whole pass lazy and unthinking lives. Filled with the dread of the near approach of death, and dead to the refinement of feeling, their motto is, " let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die." It has been generally found that Europeans are badly able to bear the effect of the climate and of the manners usually practised in Java. Not more than one out of five of the new comers, on an average, survive the first year ; three out of four Europeans are supposed to be the average of the annual obituary, including the troops and sailors. It is believed that the frequency of deaths among soldiers and sailors, is owing chiefly to their own debaucheries. The inhabitants of the coast of Java consist of a variety of races — persons having come from all parts of India to dwell here ; their manners and customs fall more properly under the description of the several countries in which they were born — however a short

Experience, however, justifies the belief that it would have been more prudent to have gone direct to sea, if sufficient hands had been left to work the vessel ; for the Leven and Barra couta had not had one taken ill after quitting the bay, and those only died whose cases were previously considered hopeless. " It is usual to attribute this fever to the marsh miasma, which possibly may not be without foundation ; but there was very little marshy ground within several miles of the Cockburn. The banks of the river were however wooded, and twice a day the tide left a considerable portion of mud exposed to the sun, the exhalations from which were carried by the breeze in every direc tion. This cause may have produced the baneful effect, but others certainly existed which served very much to aggravate, if not to originate the disease. " The musquitoes were so numerous on board, and indeed everywhere, that it was absolutely impossible to obtain any rest night or day. Their incessant buzz and occasional attack were more dreadful than can easily be imagined ; it was irri tating, nay, almost maddening, and produced as

Shortly after we had anchored, Captain Vidal, who had been alarmed by the appearance of the weather, came on board, and on the 26th we re moved to the anchorage off Quilimane. This town is built on an unhealthy marsh, to drain which no efforts appear ever to have been made. It contains ten houses inhabited by the Portu guese, fifteen by the Creoles, and seven by the merchants from Goa, with innumerable huts for slaves belonging to the Portuguese, in all amount ing to a population of about two thousand eight hundred persons. The houses belonging to the whites, (as the descendants of the Portuguese are called, although sometimes as black as the negroes themselves,) are constructed of brick, and faced with tiles ma nufactured on the spot from the clay of the river. They are substantial, and, in two or three in stances, of great size. The governor's is erected with imitation stone, in the Italian style, and is very commodious. The houses generally contain only one story, the floor being elevated a little above the ground to avoid the marshy dampness and miasma that evaporate from the soil. The roofs project several feet beyond the walls, and rest at their termination on a row of pillars, forming a broad and commodious gallery or verandah, to

The city is choked with rubbish ; the lands want draining. But to return to the top of St. Peter's: we went up into the ball on the top of the dome, and found that, although it does not appear much larger than a man's head from below, it was of a size sufAcient to hold twenty two persons. Another fact may better show the immensity of this structure. The dome of St. Peter's is as large as the Pantheon, or rather larger indeed. That is to say, it is one hundred and forty feet in diameter at the base, and one hundred and seventy-nine feet high.* Michael Angelo boasted that he would " hang the Pan theon in air," and this cupola :s raised more than two hundred feet above the pavement of the church. But what is raised? Why, a mass of masonry ; not a wooden dome, but a cupola of brick, ?weH?y-?Aree _/ee? in thickness !

In my earliest super ficial glance, I was puzzled to understand how malaria could be generated where so great a quantity of oxy gen must be constantly in process of development, amongst trees and shrubs of such perpetual verdure as those which gird the embouchures into the sea of all the West- African rivers. Yet that malaria and fever are cause and effect in Western Africa, as they are all the world over, there can be no doubt to any person who has once penetrated that region. At certain seasons of the year, as soon as we come within the sphere of the germination of malaria, our olfactory nerves frequently make us sensible of its presence. Walking along pathways through the bush wood, and far away from what we are apt to consider as the indispensables of decomposition, we occasionally become conscious of a " steamy vapour," which flies up with an intensity sufficient to bring on an attack of ague (with persons predisposed to it) in the course of a few hours. Voyaging in a boat up the creeks that abound in the rivers of the Bight of Biafra, an odour of a more disagreeable flavour, but not so suddenly oppres sive, often greets us. Endemic fever attacks a large proportion of the crews of nearly every ship sent out for the purpose of trading ; and the ultimate chances of recovery depend, perhaps, as much, if not more, on the diminution of the main exciting cause, by removal of the invalid from its influence, as on the idiosyncrasy of P 3

But Malta, the Piræus, and Galli poli were attacked. At Gallipoli the Hospitals were thronged, and 1 " The heat is tropical," writes an officer of the Marshal's Staff; " the waters dry up, the fountains are exhausted, the occasional rivulets are empty.

The events of the last two years in Nicaragua must be hereafter the subject of elaborate historical writings ; and the facts for such a work may here be found. A second volume to be prepared from tho most authentic and reliable sources, will be issued hereafter, for the purpose of detailing the future operations of the American party in Spanish Amer- ica. Exciting as have been the events in Nicaragua for the last twelve months, it is believed that the most extraordinary occurrences are yet to agitate the Southern portion of the North American Continent. That the effete and decadent descendants of the early Spanish colonists must eventually succumb and give place to the superior activity and intelligence of the Anglo-Saxon, none who have lived in Central America or Mexico wdl dispute. The 'im " Manifest Destiny" is no longer a myth for paragraphists and enthusiasts ; the tide of American population, stayed on the shores of the Pacific, seeks new channels ; and already the advanc- ing step of the blue-eyed race is heard among the plains and valleys of Central America.

There are many inexplicable causes which produce wonderful diversity of climate. Thus, if I were called upon to judge from analogy, I should have no hesitation in saying that Australia was a most unhealthy country for Europeans ; for the estuaries of its rivers, its creeks, salt-water inlets and mud flats, abound in mangroves, which have been con sidered by the best authorities the chief cause of the unequalled unhealthiness of the rivers on the coast of Western Africa. Again, there are in Australia an infinite number of tea-tree morasses, and reedy swamps, covered with stagnant water and rank vegetation ; and the changes in the temperature, between day and night, are probably greater in Australia than in any other country, and are also very sudden. Nevertheless, the experience of upwards of half a century has now ascertained that no country in the world is more exempt from all that class of disorders which originate in impure air, and deleterious miasma, than Australia. Indeed, when I informed some persons in Sydney a few years ago, that ague was prevalent at the lower part of the MacLeay river, I was listened to with great incredulity, it seemed to them so totally incom patible with the climate of the colony ; yet the reader will not wonder that cases of ague should occur at the MacLeay, for beside the mangrove

My curiosity Avas not strong enough to enable me to endure the horrors of a walk over the dead and dying animals, so I fled to the boat, and, under the protection of a thick cloak and huge umbrella, waited there until the others had seen enough. For hours the yacht was passing through the swarm, or detachments of it. Such numbers of the disgusting insects fed on the deck that two men were constantly employed in sweeping them into the sea. Every window, e\Tery crevice, Avas kept care fully closed, for fear that one of them should get below. There is something inexpressibly reArolting about these horrid animals. They fly, they craAvl, and they cling, and, after having come in contact Avith them, we could Avell understand Avhat a frightful infliction the plague of them in Egypt must have been.

Here they remain several years, only occasionally visiting theft parents. During this period they are taught warlike exercises, and are encouraged to encounter every description of danger and fatigue. Often are these hardy lads sent into the mountains during the severest winter weather to pass then days in the saddle, their only shelter at night a cave or an overhanging rock, their only food the roots of grasses and herbs. No Avonder that the Russians find it hard to subdue men who not only from their earliest youth have been thus inured to hardship, hunger, and thirst, but are also entrenched amidst the wddest of mountain fastnesses — fastnesses that can only be reached by many days' journey through forests and over morasses, where vegetation grows with such rank luxuriance that few Avould encounter willingly the dangerous miasma that reigns there nearly all the year.

It has been known to grow fifteen feet in one year, and ought to be planted all over the plains and valleys. It would give verdure, shade, and rain to desert places, and would be a fortune to farmers who had a few acres of such beautiful forest, The timber, too, is good and valuable. The Eucalyptus also possesses extraordinary power of destroying the influence of miasma in marshy districts. When planted in swampy ground it will dry it up very soon. In Algeria I have seen several plan- tations of the Eucalyptus on farms once noted for their extreme unhealthiness, but on which, since the planting of this tree, no cases of fever have occurred. Near Constantine, too, where formerly there were several acres of marshy fever-haunted soil, a few plantations of these trees soon transformed the land into a dry salu- brious park, from which fever has entirely disappeared. It is known that many strong- smelling flowers develop ozone in sufficient quantities to counteract the influence of a malarious situation ; there is, therefore, all the more reason to give credit to the health-giving qualities of the Eucalyptus. Planted singly, the tree is not picturesque, but in numbers is very pleasing. One evening in San Francisco I witnessed a sad occurrence. Whilst in the act of crossing a street I heard

At night the tempera ture of the atmosphere falls, dense miasma rises from the swamps and rivers, heavy dews are sometimes ex perienced, and it is not uncommon for the European residents to avail themselves of a fire. If duty should call the white man abroad at this time, he is recom mended to wear a respirator ; and a physician of long experience on the coast has informed the present writer that he never sleeps at night without a thin veil spread over his face. The importance of wearing flannel next the sur face of the body cannot be too strongly insisted on ; the trunk ought always to be protected by a cummer band or waist-belt ; and the daily use of quinine ought also to be observed until the constitution has be come accustomed to the climate. These precautions, although sanctioned by the highest authority, are, unfortunately, not always adhered to ; and the new arrival, startled by the numerous deaths that occur around him in despite of medical skill, is not uncom monly hurried to the conclusion that there is some latent feature of the disease which has eluded the penetration of the physician, and that it is the wiser part to study its phenomena, and form an independent opinion for himself. Fatal error! and one that has consigned not a few of its

Three generations of brave pioneers fell victims to the task ; but neither miasma, nor incendiaries, nor Arab raids deterred them from their purpose, and the result glorifies it. Numerous other villages might be named, which the labours of the colonists only have made habitable and healthy, but these two excel others in fertility. The subject of Arab incendiaries is a sore one with these hard-worked farmers ; and no wonder ! It is hardly to be supposed that a very good understanding should exist between the colonists and natives, especially when we take into consideration of what a mixed set the former consist. French, Germans, Alsatians, Spaniards, Maltese, and occasionally Ameri cans, make up the colonist population ; each and all naturally prejudiced against men who worship Mahomet and marry two wives. But doubtless their antipathy is fully shared by the Arabs, and at any rate, they take a very antagonistic part towards the representatives of the conquered race, stealing their cattle and burning their crops without remorse.

Once the darkness had fallen, to steer our way out of that seven hundred acres of corn would, my guide informed me, be utterly impossible, and to remain in it would be almost certain death, from the miasma, the terrible attacks of the mosquitoes, or the venomous bites of the snakes, which abound in these low, swampy lands. Having laid this position of affairs clearly before me, my cavalier awaited my decision as to the choice of evils. I decided for trying the corn-fields. So into the corn and swamp we went with a desperate plunge, our horses every now and then sinking up to their knees in the ground, which, owing to the recent rains, had become nothing less than a quagmire, through which it required the most strenuous exertions to force the horses and hold them on their feet. Every moment I was thumped, and lashed, and beaten by the rebound of the corn-stalks, then tickled in the face by the " parlour brooms," then caught by the hair behind. Darkness was speeding on with sable wings. The horses were continually plunging forward on their knees, and the frightful certainty was ever present to my mind, that if I lost my seat I could never regain it.

He had won fame, it is true, but he knew that a reputation, like a title, requires means to support it. There is some thing pitiable in a moneyless celebrity, as there is in a moneyless noble : jewels and rags do not go well to gether. And what would his reputation have obtained him ? A private secretaryship, or a small government post at the Hague. But to be rich and then to be poor, to be courted and then to be cut, to walk about in the same streets, to meet the same people, including Louise, to offer himself day after day as a target for slander and sar casm — that was not to be thought of for a moment. And what else could he do ? Whatever service he might enter he would have to begin at the bottom of the tree. He was certainly right to do as he had done When the five years were over he would be forgotten ; he would have his little pension ; with that and whatever remained of his money, he might enter a business or one of the professions. How different were his feelings when he saw the coast of Africa again ! When the steamer entered the river of Sierra Leone, and all the passengers were gazin° with delight upon the scene, Roelof's heart sank within him. It seemed to him that this exquisite loveliness of nature was a rnoyskery, a trick ; a mask, which covered the horrible countenance of Death. When the dusk of evening had set in he pointed to a grey mist which ascended from the earth. ' That is the miasma,' said he, ' I have seen it also in the Pontine marshes.'

In their en thusiasm for European genius, they abandoned themselves to the most fanciful conjectures, and never doubted but that we could seal up death as surely in a microscopical tube as in our largest and strongest cannons. Thus, a bunch of key*s one day fell from my pocket. They7 were picked up by one of Taher's companions, who, examining them, and perceiving that they7 were perforated, said, — " Are not these pistols ? Are they loaded ? The Franks invent astonishing things !" The last traces of the rainy season had nearly disappeared. The air no longer exhaled un wholesome miasmas ; but to fever, and mud, and pestilential flies, succeeded another species of torture. Tall bushes covered the soil ; and each tuft of grass, each bush, was armed with the most formidable spines, which a malignant genius, apparently, had assembled together on purpose to put my patience to the test. Lances, swords, daggers, knives, needles, hooks, and forks alter nately rent our garments, and so embedded themselves, that we might well fancy ourselves invested in a porcupine's skin, with the bristles turned inward. Happily, the increasing dryness of the soil soon delivered us from this torture. We burned the grasses, and pushed forward into the heart of a splendid country.

At times, the iruansa is converted into a ball-room, a salon de danse, as you may guess from the large drums suspended from the walls. Sometimes, also, when the stage was a long one, we passed the night under the roof of the starry heaven. One morning, we had not resumed our march above an hour, when I saw Ouelda stop suddenly, and then support himself, swooning, against a tree. He trembled from head to foot ; his eyes glowed with the fire of fever ; and his colourless lips vainly attempted to smile. " It is nothing," he said, with an effort ; " only my head aches, and I am cold." Immediately I had my litter made ready, and my warmest coverlets. The child was laid upon them, and we directed our steps towards the nearest village. We were compelled to cross a patch of marshy ground ; the wind shook the tall papyrus reeds, which towered above the litter like the black plumes of a hearse. The sun darted his fiery rays upon the stagnant waters ; putrid miasmas were thrown off, and a suffocating atmosphere enveloped us as in a wet cloak. Gloomy and depressed, and suffering also from the fever, I marched slowly at the head of my little company. Towards evening we halted at a wretched village. Ouelda had fallen into a

The transit was made in perfect safety, and once on the bank the bugle sounded "forward!" I embraced Baba Tuka, to whom I had become greatly attached, and plunged into the jungle, whose morass and miasma were now augmented by the deluge of rains that had fallen since the month of May, when I had passed through it. The jungle-grass, wet and sodded, formed a net-work at times across the path, through which we could only make our way by cutting through it with bayonet and knife. The rain fell incessantly in torrents, and the wild un- inhabited jungle of more than one hundred miles, was thus rendered almost impassable. Though sick and feeble, the energy that hope kindled, caused me to tax the marching qualities and endurance of my men to the very utmost. From six o'clock in the morning until six at night became our day's work ; urging my men to this by the pro- mise of better days at Fatiko. I knew it to be a race for life : and I felt a sort of mad pleasure in breaking through this jungle, or wading to my waist in mud, when my horse was no longer able to carry me over it. From time to time the monotony of the route was varied by the rush and trumpeting of a herd of elephants across our path, at which we got uncertain shots, or the mad-

The whole country is so low, that during the greater part of the year it is a dismal, dreary swamp, poisonous and impracti cable, which, from the earliest time, must have pre sented the greatest difficulties to the trade of this river — the ancient " Phasis." 'Would it be too far-fetched to recognise in its deadly miasma the veritable dragon of the Golden Fleece ? The rivers are said to have gold in them, which is caught by woolly sheepskins, placed wool up in the river's bed, to catch the gold, and led Strabo to fable the Golden Fleece. The bar is shallow, with not more than five feet of water.

After steaming slowly up against the current, we arrived at Poti at 8.30 a.m., and made fast to the Government wharf.

Otherwise the children seemed very healthy, notwithstanding their rags and dirt, and not a single case of fever was observed, though about sixty or seventy patients were treated for other diseases. The fact that by far the greater part of the valley is under water for six or seven months, during three of which it is little better than a huge morass, would not seem to recommend it as salubrious ; but it must be remembered that it lies more than five thousand feet above the level of the sea, in the twenty-fourth parallel of north latitude, and is a comparatively dry and temperate country, singularly destitute of trees, which conditions would combine to place it beyond the range of miasma. The worthy governor showed great anxiety about our health.

So great was the insecurity that we dared not ven ture more than a few hundred yards from the walls unattended. A favourite walk was to a place less than a mile to the north-west of the town.

Long iron nails and a hammer were also among ou_# appUances. Actual experience considerably modified these arrangements, and compelled us in almost all cases to resort to methods as much open to a savage as to people acquainted with the mechanical arts. Throughout the latter half of July rumours from the Matterhorn were rife in the Bernese Oberland, and I felt an extreme dislike to add to the gossip. Wishing, moreover, that others who desired it might have a fair trial, I Ungered for nearly three weeks among the Bernese and Valasian Alps. This time, however, was not wasted. It was employed in burning up the effete matters which nine months' work in London had lodged in my muscles— in rescuing the blood from that fatty degeneration which a sedentary life is calculated to induce. I chose instead of the air of a laboratory that of the Wetterhorn, the Galenstock, and the mountains which surround the Great Aletsch glacier. Each succeeding day added to my strength. There is assuredly morality in the oxygen of the mountains, as there is immorality in the miasma of a marsh, and a higher power than mere brute force lies latent in Alpine mutton. We are re cognising more and more the influence of physical elements in the conduct of life, for when the blood

Leaving this carter to settle his differences with his ox as he best can, we ride into a village of some pretensions as to size. The houses are mostly built of mud and thatched with grass (a few, such as the houses of a well-to-do money-lender or zemindar, maybe humble structures of bricks), and, save in the roadways between them, imbedded in jungle. We might call this jungle the luxuriant growth of vege tation and make poetical capital out of it thereby, but the term rank jungle better describes that mass of foliage and underwood which shuts out all pure air and disseminates noxious gases causative of disease. Up to the very walls there is a wilderness of trees, shrubs, creepers, weeds and grass, the home of the cobra, and the manufactory of miasma. Even the roof is not free, for trailed upon it are creepers of the pumpkin tribe, or some sort of esculent. Here and there about the village are stagnant pools covered with duck- weed, and highly suggestive of cholera and other epidemics. And nowhere (unless a sanitary commissioner may have enforced it) is there any show of drainage, sewerage, or other measures for the preservation of health. The native of the south is quite contented that things should be so. They were so in the time of his father and grandfather, and

European beds are a real luxury after a long inland journey, and so is a well-furnished table, and especially good wholesome bread. We should, however, have torn ourselves away sooner from these allurements but for the touch of intermittent fever, which confined me most of the time to the house. It seems, indeed, wonderful that we should hitherto have escaped, considering that we are now in the fever season; I attribute it in great measure to the little bag of Peruvian bark we all wear on the pit of the stomach, suspended from the neck, so as to be in contact with the skin. Our servant, Carabed, far better inured to the climate than ourselves, is the only one of the party who has had a real attack of the fever; and we had neglected to provide him with this prophylactic, on the supposition that he was proof against the miasma. We have been looking over the route thus far pursued from Tocat hither, and what yet remains to be done. We find the whole distance by this route from Tocat to Smyrna is 202 Turkish hours. Our rate of travel has never been so low as four miles an hour ; but we have generally done our task in shorter time than is usually reckoned, so that the whole distance may fairly be reckoned 810 miles. Some of our party7 have ascended the high hill at the back of the town, and have brought me specimens of red trachyte, containing crystals of feldspar, which

But it was a dreary journey, and, as the evening closed in, the fatal mists rose with their deadly miasma over the great plain which we were slowly traversing, and we no longer wondered that our good sisters' hospital at Marengo was so full. Arrived at the station, we found on the platform a poor man moaning and writhing in all the agonies of ague fever and almost unconscious. We gave him some oranges, which he eat whole and so rave nously that it seemed as if his thirst had become unbearable. The poor fellow was returning to Blidah where his mother was, from whom he had been tempted by high wages to seek work in the plains — only alas ! to meet his death, it appeared ; as at the next station we sawr him lifted out by the porters as if all were over. That evening we returned to Algiers, little thinking that in less than three months from that time, a simultaneous Arab rising would have carried fire and sword into the heart of the beautiful country we had traversed, and that smoking homesteads and charred and blackened forests would have replaced the comfortable-looking farm buildings and smiling wood lands of the Mitidja !

Houses, as already mentioned, are difficult to be had, and have to be taken without always attending to convenience of locality. Ventilation as a rule is good, drainage bad, and generally not OATer clean. In low-lying localities the houses are not free from miasma and air-poison ings ; but such annoyances are not, on the Avhole, here to be dreaded ; neither arc the risks of health from these causes greater than in other parts of the world. The standard of work is much lower than in England; but there is no doubt that in turning out work, high-classed artisans in Para, as elsewhere, try to sustain their character. As "to making a stand against their turning out bad Avork," — the quality of work being often, at the best, inferior, and the wages of workmen, or the charges made almost Avhat such workmen choose to exact, — this question does not seem applicable to Para, but is more so to places where the AAdiolesale manufacture of class articles occurs. No doubt the sense of honour of many artisans would lead them to be careful in their work ; but there is, I apprehend, no class of this kind. To conclude, I have to observe that any intelli gent, skilful, aud sober artisan would be, and is, certain of remunerative employment in Para. There are difficulties at first to be contended with, such as the language, house-accommodation, and

The appearance of the town of Banias is some what peculiar, for on the top of each flat roof the inhabitants erect wicker-work cages of oleander boughs, and stand them on four upright poles. These can only be reached by a ladder, and are used as sleeping places at night ; the villagers hoping by this device to escape the scorpions and other insects which abound here during the sum mer heat. The people are said to suffer much from ague. A poisonous miasma rises from the marshes of Huleh in the autumn, and makes the place, fascinating though it was to our eyes, very unhealthy. It is now generally supposed that it was on a spur of Hermon, not far from Banias, that the transfiguration of Our Lord took place. The

The repast, — to which I fear I could not do all the justice my host desired — being at an end, I took a stroll with him in the neighbourhood of the kraal. In the course of our walk we came upon five heaps of stones which mark the graves of five Europeans, who are there taking their last sleep, lying side by side beneath the shadow of some trees, in the same soil which insinuated into their system, through the miasma it ex haled, the poison that was to cut short their existence at so premature an age.

Uncon sciously we may stand upon a spot beneath which lie mouldering the remains of brave men who have left in far distant countries affectionate mourners, who have not even the bitter pleasure of dropping a tear upon the soil which imprisons those so tenderly loved in life ! Happier in this respect, the five graves at Pata matenga enclose the bodies of men who are known, and whose names I here record ; and if friends are still left to cherish their memory, it will be a sad satisfaction

I saw as many old men there, in propor- tion to the population, as I have seen in NeAV York, Paris or London, and Aboo Sinn had already com pleted his century. Egyptians and Europeans suffer more from the climate than natives ; but it is often because they indulge extravagant tastes, and are intemperate in eating and drinking. Nearly all the foreigners who go there drink inordinately, and then expose themselves to the sun. This climate has its rules of health, the same as that of New York. It is very easy to freeze to death during the terrible cold in America ; it is likewise possible to be charred into a corpse by the blazing sun of Africa, if you do not take the proper precaution.

Whether this be the cause or not, it is certain that at S. Antonio the labourers died so rapidly that the undertaking had to be abandoned, after something like 90,0001. had, it is said, been spent, for which there is now nothing to show but a slight scratch in the ground — representing the first cutting — a house, a few rough sheds, some cleared land, two wrecks in the harbour, and several great heaps of the cases of tinned meats and broken bottles. Our friend, Mr. Davis, had accepted the theory, given above, of the cause of the unhealthiness of S. Antonio, and with characteristic vigour, had set about remedying it, immediately after his arrival there. At every important pool he had blown up some of the surrounding rock, thus completely draining it ; and where this was not possible he had set men to pump it dry. Around the house he had enlarged the clear ing and planted bananas and vegetables for the use of the settlement. In the midst of these labours, in which he had taken more than his proper personal share, he was suddenly struck down, — the victim, not so much of the prevalent fever, as of a general prostra tion of the system through excessive fatigue. It is painful to think of the uselessness of this sacrifice of a valuable life ; for the American engineers reported against the feasibility of the undertaking, and it was once more abandoned.

The flourishing growth of citronella and lemon grass, from which essential oils are extracted, must not lack mention ; while the question of grass naturally suggests pasture-land, which is somewhat wanting, for this is no home of grazing cattle, like the park-like stretches of Australia. There is however a great variety of grasses in the peninsula. Capital sweet nutritious meadow-grass is grown at Penang and Singapore, upon which both horses and ponies thrive well; but the grass generally of the Settlements, except in Northern Perak, is not particularly good or fattening for cattle. In connection with the clearing away of the jungle, and preparing the ground for cultivation, there are one or two curious points to consider. One is, that if the tad trees are cut down the brushwood should be left, or its place supplied with some other growth, otherwise miasma is likely to rise and produce fever. Secondly, the action of nature is so rapid that, in clear ing away the trees and brush, or, as the Malays call it, tabas-tabang, no more should be cleared than is required for use, otherwise the ladang will run into lallang. In other words, the cleared but uncultivated land will be speedily overrun by a rank grass (Gramen caricosum) the roots of which are more expensive and difficult to clear away than the jungle that previously occupied

At the Antipodes, by the absorption of the miasma and its transformation into a picturesque vegetation, this well-known tree has not only beautified the landscape, but it has been for ages preparing a healthful home for the settlers of our own times. All these results may be attained in Cyprus, but it will only be after we have, at much cost of money, health, and life, triumphed over our difficulties, and achieved success. In like man ner the Imperial policy, of which the occupation of Cyprus is the first experiment, may bring us to a final triumph in Asia ; but it will be after unwonted prowess, terrible sacrifices, and efforts to be undertaken only by a Titanic race. I may here take occasion to correct one mis take which has become prevalent. When reform in Asiatic Turkey is now mentioned, the geo graphical area is invariably limited to Asia Minor. But Asia Minor is only a part of Asiatic Turkey, and the convention, according to its exact terms, applies to the whole. What does this mean? That Asia Minor is the only part of the empire left free to the operations of our reforming zeal. France has been our faithful ally for many years, and she claims

Having diminished our speed, steaming slowly as night closed in, we entered the Sea of Marmora ; as daylight broke the following morning most of us were on deck to catch the first view of Constanti- nople. But what a contrast in the weather had a few short hours produced ! A bitterly cold north easter prevailed as we caught sight of the hospital of Scutari on the Asiatic side, rising out of a bank of fog hanging over the shore. It was that torpid sort of dense heavy mist which prevails in these localities, with fever as the sure accompaniment, and where, as the sun sets, the miasma steams up and continues until dispersed by the next morning's heat. In tro pical climates such localities are, if possible, avoided. The distant slabs standing about the hospital showed the resting-place of many a British officer. How thickly sown these melancholy tributes ap peared ! And yet they were not a tithe of the num bers since erected there. On the European shores tall buildings, like manufactories, edged the coast, approaching the mosques and minarets of Constanti nople. Perhaps the want of sun, or the bitter wind and chilly atmosphere, or possibly too highly wrought anticipations caused disappointment. The

The property of the colonists is disregarded, the native goatherds drive their beasts into the corn, and several riots have occurred, Avhich resulted in trials from Avhich the colonists got no satisfaction. The indiscretion of the younger men has brought greater difficulties on the community ; they have repaid insolence Avith summary punishment, and finding no help from the Government, have in many instances taken the laAV into their own hands. Thus the colony finds itself at feud Avith the surrounding villages, and the hostile feeling is not unlikely to lead to very serious difficulties on some occasion of popular excitement. There are other reasons which militate against the idea of the final success of the colony. The Syrian climate is not adapted to Europeans ; and year by year it must infallibly tell on the Germans, exposed as they are to sun and miasma. It is true that Haifa is, perhaps, the healthiest place in Palestine, yet even here they suffer from fever and dysentery, and if they should attempt to spread inland, they will find their difficulties from climate increase tenfold.

I have neither the wish nor the power to enter on any description of the affairs of Hungary. They have been the subject of so many polemics, and in recent times of so much bitterness, that I do not wish to add a grain to it by any experiences of my own. The future will sIioav whether the cherished idea of the Magyars will be realised, that they are a privileged nation destined to rule over others, and to found a great Magyar empire. It would not be advisable to pass any opinion now on what may or may not be realised, for many things more incredible have come to pass. One thing is certain, that they will not fail of the mission, to which they think themselves destined by Providence, by undervaluing themselves. The unhealthy climate of the Banat, the notorious Hungarian intermittent fever, affected even me. I thought myself steeled by my travels against all climatic influences, and that, having borne the heat of the tropics, I could certainly bear the climate of the forty-sixth degree of latitude. But the sudden changes of tempera ture, the alternations of icy cold blasts with great heat, and the miasma from the rich soil of the Banat after rain, followed by sunshine, are so injurious to the health that a stranger rarely escapes attacks of fever. In my case, the malady assumed its most dangerous form, that of continued but outwardly scarcely percep tible feverishness. After I had struggled with it for years, my husband insisted on leaving the country, as change of climate is the only remedy.

His enemies were too strong for lrim ; his correspondence by degrees accumulated in the central bureau of the police, and when at last one letter more damning than all the rest oame to hand, be was anested, tried, and condemned. That letter was written to a dying nun, and was never opened by her. Mandana is now pay ing the penalty of this last venture of his at Cayenne, where he is to remain for life, that is to say for fourteen years, which is two lives in that land of miasma. There are many heroes, counts by instinct, like Mandana, with sentiments bland, and with deeds as artfully packed as the portmanteau of a private smug gler. It really demands a mistrustful character to see into them ; at least until suffering from them personally, and so acquiring that happy bias which seems so necessary to the formation of a sound judgment.

We saw it ere long in the distance, on the crest of the Sahel, standing out against the sky, looking like a huge round topped haystack. Passing along the edge of the plain, we presently came in sight of the great bare patch of ground marking the bed of the AUoula Lake, a stagnant sheet of water formed within the last hundred years by the deposits of the River Djer, damming up part of its stream. Government has just finished draining it by the agency of military convicts, numbers of whom have perished from its pernicious exhalations; but' the sacrifice was not uncalled for, as the whole neighbourhood was poisoned, and coloni zation in that part rendered a deadly impossibility. As it was only the shallowness of the lake, of course, causing it to dry up during the heats, which bred miasma, it is a pity the water has not been gathered into a deep tank, thus securing not only a supply for proprietors on the spot, but, as is always the case with tanks, feeding the neigh bouring springs and wells by infiltration.

Indeed, we could not fad to remark all over the province the absence of that misery and starvation which had latterly become so pre valent among the poorer natives of the province of Algiers, and, as we heard, in even a more aggravated form among those of Oran.

003970308	003970308_63	62 HISTORY OF EYAM. One writer states that infection and contagion have their origin in animalculæ ; and, therefore, their infancy, maturity, and decline. The bubo of the plague is full of them. And Cooper says, " If this opinion be well founded it is no wonder that a chemical examination of the atmosphere cannot detect miasma, which does not depend on the state of the atmosphere." " Is not con tagion," says Dr. Dwight, " such a fermentation of an ani mal body as generates animalculæ, and hence the danger of contact ; and is not exemption after infection, evidence that the germs in that subject have been exhausted." The plague generally manifested itself by the febrile symptoms of shivering, nausea, headache, and delirium. In some, these affections were so mild as to be taken for slight indisposition. The victim in this case generally attended his avocation until a sudden faintness came on, when the maculae, or plague-spot, the fatal token, would soon appear on his breast, indicative of immediate death. But in most cases the pain and delirium left no room for doubt : on the second or third day, buboes, or carbuncles, arose about the groin and elsewhere ; and if they could be made to suppurate, recovery was probable, but if they resisted the efforts of nature, and the skill of the physician, death was inevitable. It has been observed, that even in the plague, the greatest enemy of the human race, there is a capricious ness, or rather something mysterious, which baffles even conjecture. The Rev, T. Dawes, chaplain to the factory at Aleppo,

Others suppose the disease is occasioned by the exhalations from the multitude of cis terns, many of which are seldom cleansed, and when low the water becomes filthy and unwholesome. Such a cause may indeed have its influence, especially late in the dry season ; but in the spring months, wdien the fever prevails most, the cisterns are full, and this supposed cause can have only a slight effect. May not, after all, the true source of the evil lie in the vast masses of rubbish accumulated upon the surface to the depth in many places of forty and even eighty feet ; the re sult of the frequent desolations of the city during the almost thirty centuries of its history ? In winter these surface masses absorb the rain water ; and in the subsequent months the burning sun causes it to exhale as miasma or malaria, producing even at this high elevation effects similar to those following like causes in other lands.

The remuneration of these teachers from the Society is very trifling ; but their wants are few, their only care being that they should be able to have a white shirt and trousers to preach in on Sundays. To strangers visiting these regions, and seeing- — even in those islands where life is now safe — the hardships the missionaries have still to under go from the climate, want of necessaries to which they have been accustomed, the difficulty of going from place to place, over rugged mountains covered with dense jungle, or in canoes exposed to the fierce sun and fever-producing miasmas, it certainly ap pears that these men ought to receive a higher remuneration for their labours. It is true they came out here " to preach the Bible to the heathen, and if they have been able to do so with success, they have had their reward." But missionaries have wives and chddren, who require clothes and food and some European luxuries, which become necessities in the torrid zone, especially in so try ing a climate as that of Samoa.

Perhaps it may be that the extremely un- healthy nature of the rice cultivation makes it abso- lutely necessary that the physical condition of the labourers should be maintained at its best to enable them to abide it ; and yet it seems to me that even the process of soaking the rice can hardly create a more dangerous miasma than the poor creatures must inhale who Uve in the midst of these sweltering swamps, half sea, half river shine. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the climate on St. Simon's is generally considered peculiarly mild and favourable, and so less protection of clothes and shelter is thought necessary here for the poor residents; perhaps, too, it may be because the cotton crop is now, I believe, hardly as valuable as the rice crop, and the plantation here, which was once the chief source of its owner's wealth, is becoming a secondary one, and so not worth so much care or expense in repairing and constructing negro huts and feeding and clothing the slaves. More pitiable objects than some of those I saw at the St. Annie's settlement to-day I hope never to see : there was an old crone called Hannah, a sister, as well as I could understand what she said, of old house Molly, whose face and figure seamed with wrinkles and bowed

As a general remark, it may safely be assumed that all the islands are admirably adapted to restore the health, and strengthen both mentally and bodily the overtaxed energies of the inhabi tants of great cities. They afford a pure clear atmosphere, con taining a large quantity of saline matter and iodine, and the frequent high winds ensure a constant freshness, preventing the depressing effect sometimes accompanying humidity. The ex treme beauty and variety of the scenery, and the infinite variety of interest offered to intelligent persons of all classes, and of all pursuits, cannot fail to prevent the ennui that sometimes destroys the effect of a change of air and scene. For those who love wild nature, Sark, Guernsey, Alderney and Herm, and the north of Jersey, are inexhaustible. For those who prefer gentler and softer beauties, the interior of Jersey is equaUy rich.

Years passed over quickly : back returning To that much loved scene, he found but ruin. Gone was all that paradise of roses ; Weeds and thorns assaUed him with their daggers.

Sud denly this high road would come out by a village, passing under a roof with forms and tables, and wayfarers seated at their little cups of tea. All the village curs would fly at us, and in the uproar the doors of the houses would be filled with the faces of women, peeriug over each other, and the children grouped around them. If we met a damsel, she would fly to such a place of shelter, or toddle — if with fashionable feet — and then turn to stare, though I must say the people were never rude or intrusive in their curiosity. The narrow streaks of land, between the barren hills, were highly cultivated, and the memorials of departed ancestors on the dry and healthy sides looked down into the inundated valleys, where their descendants, in the steamy miasma, were hastening to join them. The road began to rise from the rice "fields in long flights of stone steps, and the habit ations of the living were soon changed for the tombs of the dead.

Alas ! when, at the age which our author had now arrived at, they have to choose a profession for themselves, how arduous is the task ! What a cruel conflict then ensues between the outer world and their inner feelings — between the claims of family and the duties of life on the one hand, and the high aspirings of imagination on the other ! This is the crisis which those sons of fancy have to go through ; but which religion alone can enable them happily and successfully to go through ! Imagination is, indeed, among the most splendid faculties — it is the parent of inspiration, not only in poetry and in art, but to a great extent in philosophy and science also. But as much at least, perhaps more than any other faculty, it requires the most vigilant control. This control, however, it was precisely which in France, at the period I am speaking of, was so much wanting. The false philosophy of the eighteenth century had, even among believing Catholics, un hinged the feelings, and relaxed the moral ties. It created a moral miasma, which even the most health ful could not entirely escape from. Then the perverted eloquence of Rousseau threw an enchantment over vice and error, corrupted the feelings, led the imagination astray, inspired a disgust for the social duties, a morbid misanthropy, a con tempt for the institutions and the arts of civilized Use, and an absurd admiration for the savage state.

As for the Laotians, I have found them, although superstitious, very courageous, especially those who tra verse this forest eight or ten times a year. Some of them even venture to awake the " King of Fire " by bringing down game or shooting at robbers : yet death, even in the best season, carries off one or two out of every ten who travel here. I think the number of those who fall victims to this terrible journey must be considerable in the rainy season, when every torrent overflows its bounds ; the whole soil is soaked, the pathways nothing but bogs, and the rice-grounds covered with several feet of water. After five or six days' walking through all this, with feet in the mud, the body in a profuse perspiration, and breathing a fetid atmosphere, hot as a stove and reeking with putrid miasma, what wonder that many sink and die? Two Chinese in our caravan arrived at Korat in a frightful state of fever. One I was able to save by administering quinine in good time, but the other, who appeared the strongest, was dead almost as soon as I heard of his being ill. We halted at five o'clock in the evening and encamped on a little hill, where, in the absence of grass, our poor oxen could only appease then* hunger with leaves from the shrubs. The river, which flows down from these hills, is the same which runs near Korat, and on the opposite bank was encamped another caravan with more than 200 oxen, In a gorge of the mountain, and on the almost inac-

Some of the interviews may, however, have taken place in the Chashmah Imarat, where the fountain, whence the palace is named, is clear as diamonds, and springs up natu rally in inexhaustible abundance. In hot weather this place must have been a delicious retreat, though it could not save Sherley or Cotton from the miasma of Mazandarim, to which, in a few months after the interview with Abbas, they both fell victims. After rambling over the palaces in the town, and admiring the beautiful woods on the hills, at the foot of which the ruins are situated — woods so near that the roar of the tiger and the panther is con stantly heard from them at night by the palace keepers — we set out by a well-made road for a palace on a height, at the distance of about half a mile from Ashraf. The palace is called Safiabad, from the grandson and successor of Abbas the Great, Shah Safi, a sanguinary tyrant, who stabbed his favourite queen, and built this delightful place for his favourite daughter. The road gradually slopes up from Ashraf till it reaches the foot of a hill about

My steed was caught, but having once succeeded in baffling me, he gave me infinite trouble, and such a blow in the face with his obstinate head as almost stunned me. For the last two farsakhs to Zirab, which is about eighteen miles from Shirgah, the road passes beside rice-fields, the miasma from which is poisonous in the extreme. Men were ploughing in mud up to their thighs and the haunches of the animals, and I saw a girl with bare legs treading the rice, with the water reaching to her calves and a bitter cold wind blowing. We reached Zirab at 4.30 p.m., and found the post-house to be a vile, dirty hole, like the place cursed by the Scotch laird, where there was "neither man's meat, nor horse meat, nor place to lie down." We had several times had threatenings of fever, and how we escaped it in that pestilential den I could not imagine. Were the post-house built higher up from the swamp, things

In the thick jungle, grows the fragrant Pandanus Odora tissimus, from the flowers of which a distilled water is made, as well as a medicinal stimulant ; and the obstacles to progress are much increased by the presence of different species of Euphorbia and Mimosa. Groves of Mango and of Banyan, here and there, afford a pleasant shade from the heat, though not a secure one, for wild beasts and poisonous reptiles are often concealed there, and a still more fatal enemy lurks about in the shape of miasma — an attack from which the European seldom escapes. Dr. Hooker, in his " Flora Indica," has illustrated the botany of Orissa, but from his description it does not appear that his explorations extended to this obscure portion of India. The botany of the coast and forests had been previously investigated by Roxburgh, who resided for a considerable period at Samulcottah, in what are still called the Northern Circars ; the result of his researches appeared in his " Flora Indica," and in the extensive collec tions he made in that territory. Dr. Russell also procured a large number of plants from the same locality.

We soon went back to our camp, and enjoyed a long day in the wild and silent valley. We had to be up very early on the following morning, as we were anxious to get over the Phanari or Glyky plain before the sun was very hot, as it is unhealthy with miasma, and there was the Kleisura gorge to get through first. We did not know how long this was to take after the aAvful accounts of the path given in Leake and Lear — ' a path that none but the foot of a goat or a Suliote can tread,' &c. — but, in answer to our surprise at its excellence, Ave learned from the zaptieh that the path we trod was a new one, Avhich had only been constructed a few years. It is to be hoped that the Turks wdl continue it, for the descent into the plain below is simply execrable, not to say dangerous. It is impossible to describe the beauty of this gorge, as you fodoAV the path winding down and then up over the nearly perpendicular mountain-sides : these are clothed with the densest fohage, through which the eye catches at intervals the foaming green Acheron, rushing over the rocks of the torrent bed at bottom.

Every army has its best and worst, and I was glad to remember some of the intelligent faces and soldierly bearings I had seen in Turkey while I looked at these, so much the reverse. We encountered another set when we landed at 6 o'clock the next morning at Antivari ; a stream here winds along the middle of the little plain, on the banks of which and in which we saw some forty or fifty soldiers making theh* breakfasts and washing their clothes. They were a jolly good humoured looking set, very dirty and not much disciplined, and one wondered what on earth they did with themselves in such a place. The Turkish Government has lately been accumulating troops on this coast, and the plain of Antivari was completely covered with their green tents, as if they were taking sea-air for the benefit of their health. The plain is, however, very unhealthy from miasma of a severe kind, and the houses standing on it are but three or four at most. The town itself is at three miles' distance, lifted upon a picturesque rock and niched into a ravine ; its chief interest now is in its con taining the palace of the Archbishop of Antivari, who is also called Primate of Servia and Prince

It has been remarked that, through a fatality inherent in things here below, the finest climates are unhealthy. On the other hand, the countries that are the most happdy situated, are the worst ruled. Those persons who find a consolation for every evil, pretend that if things were otherwise, paradise would exist on earth ; I doubt it, but I believe that hell is very near the spot where the seat of paradise has been. Hell is on the shores of the Black Sea, thanks to the epidemics that reign there ; thanks also to Nicholas, who has chosen it for a place of exile. The unfortunate beings who have been banished there are continually saying, that they would prefer Siberia to the enchanting regions of Colchis ; in fact, men are not killed by cold, as they are by an atmosphere filled with pestilential miasma ; so Nicholas knows well what he is about when he banishes his enemies to a part where no one dies a natural death.

It had been a place of importance long before Rome had first risen to extensive wealth and power. It had been the capital of the island, and celebrated throughout India and China and Chin-India, for its extent and magnificence, when Athens was in its glory and when the Persian monarchy had attained its greatest splendour ! its remains attesting, at the present day, its former greatness, and amazing the traveUer by theh size and often by theh pre servation. True, the greater part of the city Hes buried beneath the aU-pervading jungle that at tacks within the tropics so unrelentingly every remnant of antiquity, and renders the preserva tion of old buildings and ruins so difficult a matter, nay, almost an impossibUity ; but still there was enough to be seen, I was assured, to gratify the most inveterate novelty-hunter — enough to interest, to amaze, and to instruct. An excursion into these regions was, however, rather a perdous matter. Jungle-fever was often caught from the miasma that pervaded the district, and numerous instances had occurred of Europeans having been attacked by it in the course of theh exploring expeditions. Not that the danger would have deterred me personaUy, for I was

The houses are all built in the very heart of a jungle of palm-trees, so thick as to pre clude all circulation of air during the dry weather ; whilst in the monsoon, and for a month after, it necessarily changes from a total swamp to a very hot-bed of miasma and fever. And thus it was that the early settlers were swept off by hundreds ; and yet the survivors continued to inhabit these pestilential regions, attracted by the shelter which their shady groves afforded from the powerful rays of the sun ; and even long subsequently to the occu pation by the English, a voyage thither was accounted somewhat in the light of a forlorn hope, or, at least, tantamount to an excursion to Sierra Leone in the present day. However, we have long abandoned Mahim, with all its shady beauties, to the natives ; and gradually, as science and taste took root among our countrymen, they betook themselves to the sea ward shores of the island, whereupon to erect their habitations ; and this, in conjunction with the constant clearing and draining so unremit-

The an nouncement was responded to by the cannons of the English and French ships of war stationed in the harbour of Palermo ; and this was con strued by the Sicilians into an unmistakable assurance of the support of both Governments. In the midst of universal rejoicing, a deputation sailed for Genoa, to convey to the young Prince the offer of the Crown. But they had scarcely reached the head-quarters of Charles Albert, ere his army was overtaken by reverses which in volved Italy and the Sicilians in one common ruin. Radetzky judged that the decisive moment had arrived. A hundred thousand troops, in a perfect state of discipline and equipment, were concentrated around Verona. The Piedmontese forces did not exceed 60,000. Of these part were carrying on the blockade of Mantua, the miasma from the swamps with which it is sur rounded having filled their hospitals with thou sands of fever- stricken victims ; — the remainder, injudiciously dispersed over a long line of opera tions, separated by a river and broken roads, and without any organized plan of communication,

But the pastures in the green spring-time of February or March are doubtless rich, for several beast-houses have been budt — not by the Moors, but by the French ; and there are large drains which, although but dry channels now, tell that the strong hand of the French Government has been at work, preparing the table for the multitude which wbl not come. We have now reached the thirty-second kilometre (twenty mbes) from Algiers, and these signs of moist ure show that we are near to Boufarik. " Twenty years ago," said to me an officer in the French Civil Service, who knows more of Africa, and of the lan guages and tribes of Africa, and of the resources of Algeria, than any other living man, " I stopped on one of my circuits to refresh myself at Boufarik. It consisted then of a pond of water, three trees, and two tents. I passed quickly on, for it was scarcely safe to repose, even for an hour, in the miasma of that marsh. At the present day Boufarik contains I am c

It is strange, when one thinks of it, how dependent we are in this country upon the state of the atmosphere. Weather here is everything, and " weather permitting " is the great rule of life. Among us nothing is more severely criticized than the weather; like politics, everybody has got his opinion about it. If it does not suit our fancy, we knit our eyebrows and get angry, and we call it by any ugly name we like. On the other hand, after a warm sunny day or two, all England smiles again ; we turn out of our houses, we talk and get merry over it, and look as pleasant as ever : though, by-the-by, it is no compliment to our English climate that we should be eidogizing it in this way, whenever we have an oppor tunity. In Egypt people never think of the weather. When they meet on the banks of the Nile, they never tell each other what a fine day, or what a lovely morning it is. Here every day is fine and every morning is lovely ; no April showers or November fogs, and none of those cold sharp English nights, that when one gets up with the dawn he finds the ground " crisp with hoar frost." In this country we often corrupt nature, vitiating what nature has given us by certain defilements of our own ; and hence many of the nuisances of our large towns. I have seen plenty of squalor and dirt in Egypt, but certainly not more than what I have seen at home, with all our preaching and philanthropy. The Nile is never foetid with miasma, like the London Thames, and among the people generally there are few or none 5

The journey to M'Den was without incident, across a fertile country, at least as beautiful as that which I had left behind, perhaps richer, but cer tainly not so healthy, for during the rainy season these verdant plains, whose luxuriant vegetation I so much admired, are turned into swamps, which, at the return of the dry season, exhale fatal miasmas. On my arrival at M'Den, I pitched my tent near an immense baobab-tree, the indispensable ornament of every Senegambian village. The natives had probably rarely had a visit from a European, and I found myself an object of profound curiosity, but there was nothing hostile in their attitude. Some of them, squatting on the ground, watched all our movements attentively; others were gesticulating, and evidently making comments on our culinary apparatus. I sent for the Bourba, and after offering him a little guinee I asked him to send me some water, eggs, milk, and fowls. He did so without making any objection, and, thanks to him, we made a sub stantial meal, to which I added a haunch of venison from a deer I shot the day before at M'Bidjem ; I had given the other three quarters to the soldiers at the station. I passed a wretched night ; devoured by insects, disturbed by the shouts and smging of the natives,

We parted at a place where the creek divided. Oputa returned to the Niger by the western creek, while I had to go towards the north, the N'Sube country. He took an affectionate leave of me, for he seemed to have understood the kind of sympathy with which his singular character inspired me. He also tried to deter me from my project of exploring the interior of N'Sube\ ' You will meet with war,' he said, ' and will incur serious danger.' Better still, he offered me men and canoes for an escort, but I declined, for my scanty resources forbade my acceptance of them. I promised, how ever, to visit him at Ogbekin on my return from the Niger. I sent him some presents and parted from him, feeling that I had gained his friendship, of which he afterwards gave proof. The country into which I penetrated after bav in^ left the Oboshi tribes is called Esuama-Ebo. It forms the centre of the vast empire of Ebo, which extends from the country of the Akpotos and the Mitshis to the delta of the Niger, and from the western branch of the Old Calabar to Monte Video. This district of Esuama is much more healthy than the coast ; it is on higher ground and drier, and the air is not charged with the miasmas L 2

One night I had, according to custom, hung my hammock to some young palm-trees growing near a creek com municating with the river Okari, which we had already crossed, and overcome with fatigue, I had fallen asleep whde Ali kept watch. We mounted guard by turns, and I rarely slept more than two hours at a time. It had been so ever since I left the Senegambia ; when sleep was not rendered uneasy and feverish by preoccupation of mind or some imminent danger, the mosquitoes took care to disturb it. Of course I entirely gave up the habit of undressing at night ; on the contrary, in order to defend myself from the stings of insects, I fastened my clothes up, and put on more by night than by day. There is nothing for it but to make the best of it ; rest, however, under such conditions is but factitious ; the body, by dint of being worn out, reposes, but the ear is not closed, and the mind is on the alert. Sleep comes, but it is like the sleep of the somnambulist. In a less fatal climate, in a country favoured by heaven like Palestine or Syria, a life such as I was leading might have some charms, but in Central Africa I must confess that there were none what ever. Far from being poetical, the torrents of rain, the miasma from the marshes, the insects, the scanty fare, the sight of, contact with, and fear of

It is partly to him, to his advice and intelligence, that I owe the success of my enterprise, and I am too sensible of it ever to forget it. At the same time I sent to the African Inter national Association of Brussels my notes, maps, observations, and a succinct report of my travels, and they met with a favourable reception. I added to these a work on the Loualaba, intended to draw the attention of future explorers of the region of the great lakes to the presumable existence of an important branch of this river between Lake Kamo londo and the point of junction of the Loukouga with Lououa. May the name of my country be con nected with the solution of this grand problem. My collections have enriched the ethnographic and natural history museums of my country. I left Bordeaux on April 5, so that my travels had lasted eight months, and during the whole time I had not suffered from fever nor any of the other affections which have been so fatal to travel lers. Contrary to all expectation, the climate of Africa had been very indulgent to me. In spite of a thousand privations, a thousand dangers, in spite of burning skies, pestilential miasmas, mosquitoes, want of sleep, and the worry occasioned by the inadequacy of my resources — in spite of ennui, delays, and mishaps which were the inevitable

The Privy Council now ordered coal fires to be lighted in every street and alley of London and Westminster — one great fire to every twelve houses. These were kept burning three nights and days — at the end of which time they were extinguished by heavy rain. The next week there was a happy diminution in the deaths, and the survivors rejoiced in the belief that the fires had swept away the pesti lential miasma ; but the following week the deaths again rose, carrying off no less than ten thousand victims — the largest number yet swept away in seven days. But the autumnal equinox was now at hand, and the high winds, customary at this period, blew with their wonted vigour, and purified the air — the disease became less malignant, the burials per week decreased from thousands to hundreds, and in December more than seventy districts were declared free from the plague. Thousands of people gladly returned to their homes, and in the following February, the King and his court were again established at

This naturally brings us upon haunted ground, and the whole of our way thence to the mountains becomes at once a land of wonders and horrors, a battle-ground of cruel monsters and charm-proof heroes, or — as we read the story in the light of modern knowledge — of undrained swamps and deadly miasmas. The dragons have, however, for our comfort been combated and killed these many hundred years, and we, on our pilgrimage to the Ober-Ammergau Passion- Play, may feel free to enjoy the beauty of our route without fear of encountering any other monster than the demon " crowd," which will probably do its best to oust us from the corner-seats of the railway carriage, and snatch from us, if we are not careful and prepared for its wiles, the cleanest and best-appointed vehicle for our drive over the hills. The romantically-situated little village of Mtihlthal claims, in virtue of a legend generally accepted in Bavaria, to have been the birthplace of the great Charlemagne (page 7).

She soon resumed, in a great degree, her former good habits, but still there was a little of the dawdle left about her ; the remains of the dispirited ness caused by her former very unfavourable cir cumstances.' " In some other dwellings not far from the one above described, another instance of a female who had been brought up as a servant in a well-ordered house, and who, for her station, had received a very excellent religious and moral education, presented itself. Before her marriage she had been distin guished for the refinement with which she sung national airs, and for her knowledge of the Bible and of the doctrines of her Church. Her personal con dition had become of ' a piece ' with the wretched stone undrained hovel, with a pigsty before it, into which she had been taken. She was found with rings of dirt about her neck, and turning over with dirty hands Brown's Dictionary, to see whether the newly elected minister was ' sound ' in his doctrine. In this case, no moral lapse was obvious, but the children were apparently brought up under great disadvantages. " There, however, as in most cases, the internal economy of the houses was primarily affected by the defective internal and surrounding drainage that produced damp and wet, and thence the dirt against which the inmates had ceased to contend. On inquiry of the male labourers in the district, it appeared that almost every third man was subjected to rheumatism ; and with them, it was evident that the prevalence of damp and marsh miasma from the

As a precaution, many travelers by this route take small doses of quinine for a day or two before reaching the Isthmus and a day or two after passing it. In this way the system is pretty surely toned up against the feverish tendencies of the passage. We came into Aspinwall, in the first rain storm that we had felt since rain and hail pelted us so mercilessly on the Plains near Fort Kearney, most four months ago, and found that a dreary new town of one street, lined with hotels and shops and Jamaica negroes and negresses. These people are proof against this climate ; they luxuriate and thrive from the start here, and it was due to their importation that the railroad was finally completed, as it was, after all other importations, white and black alike, had fallen in their tracks along its line of rotting nature, stirred to revengeful miasma by shovel and pick. Aspinwall has no past like Panama, no present and no future but what the railroad and steamships make for it. There was a political revolution and civil war in progress on the Isthmus as we came through ; but what it was all about, nobody could intelligently tell us ; and we were not half so ex cited by the fact as we should have been over the ebullition of a neighboring volcano, — the latter be ing the more strange and interesting event here in Central America than the former. The town had little to interest us ; plenty of tropical fruits and imported liquors ; plenty of cheap stores, but no " bargains," and not a wanting watch crystal on the Isthmus !

Its officer, as a living man, may have human virtues and a thought in his brain, but as the tool of an institution, a jailer or constable it may be, he is not a whit superior to his prison key or his staff. Herein is the tragedy ; that men doing outrage to their proper natures, even those called wise and good, lend themselves to perform the office of inferior and brutal ones. Hence come war and slavery in ; and what else may not come in by this opening? But certainly there are modes by which a man may put bread into his mouth which will not prejudice him as a companion and neighbor. " Now turn again, turn again, said the pinder, For a wrong way you have gone, For you have forsaken the king's highway, And made a path over the corn." Undoubtedly, countless reforms are called for, because society is not animated, or instinct enough with life, but in the condition of some snakes which I have seen in early spring, with alternate portions of their bodies torpid and flexible, so that they could wriggle neither way. All men are partially buried in the grave of custom, and of some we see only the crown of the head above ground. Better are the physically dead, for they more lively rot. Even virtue is no longer such if it be stagnant. A man's life should be constantly as fresh as this river. It should be the same channel, but a new water every instant.

In replying to my kind-hearted correspond ent's letter, I said the attack had been public, and on an occasion when more than three times the usual number forming the congregation at the Cathedral Service were present: that the Preacher was bound to make some 'amende honorable' when he might next be invited to speak from that pulpit : that while he, in blind bigotry and ignorance, was railing against men fully as sensible of their religious obligation- as he him. -elf could profess to be, and quite as unselfish in their views and feelings as any ofthe devotees of his own faith, — (on wdiich I would refrain from making any observations, whatever might be my convictions on that head), — our Metropolitan Clergy were exhibiting, not only to England, but to the World, a pure and bright example of faithfulness and Christian courage, standing, as they were, like Aaron, between the living and the dead and dying, where pestilential miasma and infection in their most perilous forms surrounded them on every side : that this deterred them not from then aggressive house to house visitations and personal efforts to mitigate the sufferings and the horrors of that pestilence which the French people especially dreaded — the Cholera.

During eight months every year the y^ellow fever rages and diminishes the number of Europeans who have been attracted to it by the interests of trade, and also of those Mexicans who, having been born in the higher part of the country, are obliged to pass some time in the dreaded port. The dangerous miasmas of the toAvn are quite harm less to the real inhabitants. The causes of the pe culiarly raging character of the disease are to be attributed in part to the high sand-doAvns which hinder the free current of air, and in part to the morasses which surround the toAvn, and which ex hale noisome vapours from the decaying animal and vegetable stuff, or to the bad drinking-water and the excessive heat that prevails in Vera Cruz.

" Of course this advice respecting remaining hire lings will apply only to those who find themselves in a vast and thinly populated country, but the great point of the paragraph is to warn men against the too prevalent notion that affluence and ease are readily acquired in America. Many English think that the best thing to be done with poor relations, troublesome chddren, and the like, is to ship them off to the States, whereas they are only sending them to a land where energy and industry alone can secure a man without capital an honest livelihood. The terrible state of morals in NeAv York is of course attributable in a great measure to the fact that aU the off-scourings of Europe have been cast upon her shores.

The habits of the Egyptians, if not wholly unclean — for they are fond of washing — are in other respects radically insanitary. The towns and villages are filthy. The Canals, which are the only sources of water supply to the bulk of the population, are subject to every kind of pollution. In the neighbourhood of many populous places, there are "birkas," or stagnant ponds, which exhale miasma even when they are not — as they very often are — used for drinking. In the principal cities there is a certain amount of sweeping and carting away of refuse, but there is absolutely no drainage. People who have known Egypt for many years assure me that, bad as all this is, it is enormously better than what used to be, and the decrease of certain characteristic diseases, such as ophthalmia — which is still, however, very common — is quoted in proof of the assertion. It is, of course, quite possible to believe, though difficult to imagine, that there was an Egypt even more insanitary than the Egypt of to-day. But that does not alter the fact that the scope for improve ment in sanitary matters at the present time is large enough to give employment for many years to the most ambitious and energetic reformer. It is, I hope, to be regarded as the first sign of a more vigorous policy in this matter, that a man who assuredly lacks neither energy nor ambition has recently been placed at the head of the Sanitary Department. Rogers Pasha, who now occupies that position, had previously done most distinguished work as Principal Medical Officer to the Egyptian Army. It is certain that under a chief so clever, vigorous, and restless, the

" These mariners were no rude, uneducated horde, but a class of men who have passed beyond the merely animal tendency of life, and, rising above fog and miasma, live in an atmosphere mainly intellectual — men who dominate their surroundings, and in touching leave an indeli ble trace of their presence and influence behind them." " The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots " (Ezek. xxvii, 8). The commercial supremacy of these Phœnician merchants in ancient times is a well-established fact. Their trading posts were everywhere found in the Mediterranean and out on the Atlantic as far north as the " Tin Islands," as England was then called. That their route to Ceylon was a well-beaten one no one will deny. Neither of these routes required the time assigned in sacred writ to the voyages made at the time of Solomon's reign.

The first of Kapalongo's friends, another Suahili, was away on business, which occupation, we heard, comprised the conveyance of a caravan of slaves to Taborah, in the heart of German territory. Comment is superfluous ; but, the affair being none of ours, we proceeded along a road which on the high-ground made good walking — except for the tall grass, which cut the face, now and again, like whip cord, and even threatened the eyes — but which in the plains led us through swamps thigh-deep, with, for variety, a hole up to your neck. The Lukinda kept reappearing with the persistence of a dis- reputable relation, and had to be crossed now by ford and again by boat. Moreover, the masika rains still fell, though by rights they should have ceased long before we reached Mpweto's. In the summer-time these valleys are doubtless smiling meadow-land ; in March they reeked of miasma and decay ; while villages being entirely absent, despite signs of former occupation, our men had to put up with half rations and afterwards with none. On the last day of the month we got into mountain country, traversed by little torrents ; and then we crossed stretches very like our own South Downs.

The monk confirmed what people in the country had already told me of the help afforded by the Trappists to peasant agriculturists in diffi culties. The sick were, moreover, supplied with medicines gratuitously from the small pharmacy attached to the monastery. I did not ask the question, but I concluded that at least one of the fathers had a medical diploma. The medicine that was chiefly wanted in the Double when the Trappists settled there was quinine. The demand upon it was very heavy years ago, but by removing to a great extent the cause of the fever-breeding miasma, the monks have been able to economize the drug. Talking about these matters, we reached the refectory. A great cold room with whitewashed walls, and five long narrow tables with benches on each side, stretching from end to end, was the place where the monks took their very frugal meals. The tables were laid for the first meal. There were no cloths, and it is almost needless to add that there were no napkins, although these are considered so essential in France that even in the most wretched auberge one is usually laid before the guest. Trappists, however, have little need of them. At each place were a wooden spoon and fork, a plate, a jug of water, and another jug — a smaller one — of beer, and a porringer for soup, which is the chief of the Trappists' diet. Very thin soup it is, the in-

At Kaskaskia, however, there was something to captivate the eye and ravish the senses. The velvet verdure of the plain, the glossy surface of the idle river, the lofty hill with its stately forest, the air scented with the fragrance of its clustered wild flowers, the little springs gushing from its side in sparkling beauty, all reposing in the sleep of nature, with their virgin freshness then upon them — there was a landscape to charm her most capricious lover.

The whole country from Rome to within a few miles of Leghorn is marshy and totally uninteresting, and were it not for the sea breeze, almost unbearable, the miasma rising from the marsh land breeding fever and ague. For miles not a person is to be seen, and at the few stations the necessary servants there had a cadaverous and unhealthy look about them. Our stay at Leghorn was only long enough to see the famous Dockyard and the statues to the Grand Dukes of Tuscany, upon which the present inscription states that the Tuscans preferring Victor Emanuel, told these Dukes to leave, and they went forthwith. It is only a few miles to Pisa with its Leaning Tower, which is otherwise a very dead place. From thence to artistic Florence is about seventy miles, and, arrived in the former capital, a different people and a change of scene meets you. Florence has the air of a well-to-do town, and its parallel streets, with the fine bridges over the pleasant river Arno confirms the opinion. It is a Paradise for sculptors. Is it not the birthplace of the prince of all sculptors, Michael Angelo ?

A man without the influence of love may rise to any height ; love is not the absolute requirement for his elevation, as it is for woman's ; but, bound to an inferior nature, he must fall, and does fall in variably, irrecoverably, precisely down to her level. There is no hope for him. He cannot resist the fatal miasma of commonplace. He falls for ever into the dull abyss of mediocrity. We are not proof against any of the daily influences, however trivial, that surround us. Always there is a tendency to assimilation, either by ascension or de terioration, and Tennyson's proposition is as true in the converse as in the original statement : — " As the wife is so the husband — he will sink down day by day, What is fine within him growing coarse to sympathize with clay." And now, as every fable must have a moral, what shall we learn from this mythus of the fatal termination of men who " herd with narrow fore heads " ? The moral is obvious.

Through our mili tary guide not knowing the way well, we were led a round of several miles amongst the hills above Shamo. The scenery amidst these hills was ad mirable; but to one hurrying on, as I was, the knowledge of having lost time unnecessarily, besides the extra labour of ascending and descending ridges of granite and sharp stones, did not tend to increase one's enjoyment of nature. Passing the Custom-house early the next morn ing, we walked through little else than gardens of sorghum, rice, ground-nuts, and semsem, until we crossed an arm of the Bwalambwanda. This part of the Zambesi plain was thickly peopled ; and at almost every village the Banian was there ready to buy the crop as soon as it was reaped, and in many cases before it was ripe and while yet in the field. The path led through numerous mud-holes and marshes — veritable breeding-beds of malaria and miasma. We had hoped to reach Namkunga's, six miles from Mopea, before dark ; but my military friend again showed how well he knew the geo graphy of the country by leading us into a marsh, through which we waded for two mortal hours in the dark.

A case came under my notice at Amoy of a lady who, notwith standing her husband's prohibition, visited in a sedan chair the city. In about half an hour she could no longer hold out, and was brought back, having liter ally fainted. Many Europeans during their progress keep a lump of camphor in their mouths.

Amoy, which I believe to be the most loathsome town throughout the length and breadth of China — I was attacked by indisposition which clung to me for many a day after, and the nature of which pointed to malaria. But, says the sceptic, why should the miasmas be of the altogether exceptional nature which you de scribe? Well, I cannot and I will not enter into detads ; they are not fit for publication in such a work as this. I can only hint that garbage of every conceivable nature, including household detritus, is

And the miasma from the river, the rats, and the utter solitude, must have so overwhelmed with horror the wretched captives in these loathsome dungeons, that death itself would have been hailed as a deliverer. In one of these the high-spirited Benvenuto Cellini was confined, and another served as a prison for that most unhappy, most beautiful, and, according to some historians, most innocent ■of victims, Beatrice Cenci, whose lovely, tear stained face has been immortalized by Guido as that of Innocence ; and truly, if the artist has given us a faithful portrait, she must indeed have been deeply wronged. On the whole, these dungeons are certainly the most dreadful I ever saw, but the Romans say they are preferable to those of the prisons of the Inquisition. The dungeons of the latter are closed to all, save those unfortunate wretches doomed to be their inmates, few of whom ever come forth to tell the tale. But if they are indeed worse than the dark underground prison cells of St. Angelo, they must be incon ceivably and intolerably bad ; and the wretched occupants, doomed, perhaps without a trial, for some real or fancied crime, or for some religious or political offence, to linger out their days

Noticing, as we dined together, that their glasses were, and con tinued to be, empty, I began to wonder what their beverage was. Dinner over, and all the resources of my teapot exhausted, I ventured at length to question them on the subject, when I found with sur prise that they had actually arrived at the prudent and convenient course of drinking nothing at all I— and in such a thirsty land ! Karnak and Baalbek are, in some sort, rivals as regards the grandeur of their ruins and the large area they cover. The first surpasses in antiquity and in the massive grandeur of its colossal constructions ; but Baalbek must bear the palm for perfectness of proportion and for elegance of decoration. The Baalbek ruins form a most striking tout-ensemble, though one somewhat bewildering to the traveller on his first visit ; as are also those of Karnak, owing to their magnitude and ruinous extent. The sun was scorchingly hot on the morning of May 17th, which I spent among the ruins — more so, indeed, than at any other place which I can re member. I was apprehensive of a sunstroke, and therefore had to hurry my investigations more than I liked. The vast pile stands for the most part on a solid Phœnician foundation ; on this have been reared later Roman superstructures, to which the V

This was chiefly owing to the fact that slave-labour was more valuable on the Southern plantations than anywhere else. The North owed its wealth to its manufactures, fishing-trade, and commerce, all of which needed in telligent and skilled workmen ; but on the great plan tations in the South, where rice, tobacco, cotton, and sugar were raised in such quantities as to command the trade of the world, slave-labour could be better used than any other. The climate of the South, especially of Louisiana and the Gulf states, was such that it was almost an impossibility for the white man to work in the fields ; and therefore, if the soil was to be cultivated, it must be done by the negroes, who were better able to stand the scorching suns and withering heats and unwhole some miasmas of a tropical region. For this reason the growth of the South depended largely upon the number and intelligence of the slaves, and a man's wealth was reckoned as much by the negroes he owned as by his rice-fields or cotton-plan tations. Great attention was paid to the raising of strong, healthy negroes, as these always brought a better price in market ; and as the years passed, it was found that America produced so many slaves of her own, and

It matters not now what may be said by interested traders, selfish publicists, narrow-minded, grasping merchants, or discharged agents, about the dangers of this climate. We have tested it most thoroughly for six years. There is less sickness by half in the Congo basin, even in its present unprepared condition, than there is in the bottom lands of Arkansas, a state which has doubled its population during the last twenty-five years? On his treatise on the climatic causes of sickness Mr. Stanley says : " It should be begun with a confession by the author of having himself lived ignorantly for many years in Africa, just as there are men along the African coast, and up the Oil Rivers, the Niger, and the Congo, living at this minute in the densest igno rance of the dangers around them, and of the simple philosophy of living healthily and well amid these dangers. . . . " I have suffered during my long African experi ence over 1 20 fevers great and slight, and I may have suffered over one hundred before suspecting that many of these were preventible in other ways than by taking quinine and its preliminary remedies, or that there were other causes productive of fever besides malaria and miasma. The last six years in Africa have enlarged my experience greatly. Added to my own personal sufferings, have been those of about 260 Europeans, as ignorant as myself of the causes of these fevers. The sick lists of various stations have been inspected by me, and the inspection has

A history of Pres byterianism in Iowa has not been attempted, but an out line sketch of the work and the workers up to the present time has been given. A much larger volume than this would be needed to give even a brief biography of all the men who have toiled in the State. It will be seen that this has not been attempted. The biographies pre sented are only samples, and many incidents and anecdotes have been incorporated that would have been out of place in a more pretentious book. We have kept steadily before us the purpose of giving a life-like and interesting narrative of the mingled struggle and triumph, sorrow and joy, toils and pleasures of those who have brought a great State out of its nebulous religious condition into something like form and order. The whole church ought to know what its pioneers have done and are doing, and if this purposely heterogeneous volume shall contribute to this result, its whole object will have been attained. The Home Missionaries have painted their hardships in modest colors in these pages, as they are certain to do in any account they give of themselves. The storms they have faced are similar to those we are all called upon, at times, to breast. The rivers they have forded have names that are perfectly familiar to us. The hot winds which in summer have swirled the scorching sand and blinding dust and choking miasmas into their faces and down their throats and up into their nostrils are called by no African or Oriental names. Yet we must

But the officials either knew, or professed to know, nothing regarding the country beyond Talan or on either side of the highway. The river route to Yuan-kiang they were acquainted with, but said that it was almost impracticable, and they also added that the miasma emanating from the valley and sides of the hills was terrible. I did not think it wise to tell them that I had on my bed in the next room the French survey of this very route, which had been followed some thirteen years ago by Garnier's party. The result of inquiries made next day pointed to the necessity of reaching Talan, by which route it mattered little, and from thence to make an attempt to reach the Nam-hou. The Prefect and General at once returned our call, which C. W. had to make alone early in the day, as I was very busy and far from well. They both seemed very pleasant, and the Prefect, with most charming promptitude, brought an itinerary of the route to Talan with him. We had a long talk, and I conversed with him regarding the book of Lin-an aboriginal people, which I was told existed in his yamen. Of this he said he was not sure, but would try to discover the tome, and so on. The Men-tzu magistrate had told us that the Men-tzu copy had been sent to Lin-an ; but of course that was a mere /as on de parler, which I took at its value. I never expected to see another like the one which I had got hold of at Kai-hua! Both General and Pre-

This I gladly promised to do, assuring him that the gift would be valued from such a source and from so distant a land. With regard to the Mekong, he begged us to recon sider our route and return, either through Yunnan, down the Yang-tze to Shanghai, or to cross over to Burmah by Tali, following from thence the Grosvenor route. However, as I was unwilling to discuss any alternative line, and invariably assumed it was a foregone conclusion that we should go by the projected route, — he said, " I know English gentlemen go everywhere. But you do not know what the Mekong and Laos countries are at this season. Our Chinese traders will not travel in the hot season, nor remain there in the rains. Ask any one you meet on the road." Then, seeing that I was resolute, he rejoined, " Well, you must take care of the heat and the miasma." Regarding the unhealthiness of Yuan-kiang and Man-hao, he told me the Prefect of the former place had lost twenty out of the forty subordinates attached to his yamen in three years. On leaving, and saying good-bye, he placed in my hand, according to a promise, which I confess my experience of Chinese promises had led me to consider would never be fulfilled, the most valuable gift he could have given me. This was a number of sketches of the aboriginal people around Talan. I could offer him in

The kindness which is so often found by the travelling stranger gives greater reason for our regrets that so many of our friends are either down with or just recovering from fever; and even high on the mountain this appears to be little better ; whether it be that the hollows of the country, coupled with the thickness of the bush, prevents the miasma from being blown away, or that the prevailing wind brings it up from the low country beyond the Sabi river, it is difficult to say, but it certainly is a deadly fever hole. Between us and the Nyaguzwe runs the old pioneer road, and Providential Pass, so called on account of its having proved the key to the problem which faced the pioneer column, of how to pass safely through the apparently impassable range of mountains which separated them from the great Mashonaland plateau. The column had been toiling up through difficult country from the low lying regions of Tuli ; Mr. Selous, who was guiding them, had not been over this ground, and it was known to be no great distance from the Matabeleland frontier, so that, as it was obviously an awkward place to be attacked in, it was thought that Lobengula would perhaps take advantage of his opportunity.

We made little shelter huts for them and for ourselves, open at the sides, to keep off the rain and the dew, for we suffered as much from the climate, I dare say, as from anything else ; from the heat and the moisture. The air was heavy and saturated with miasma, which tells hard on the white man, added to which was the plague of being constantly surrounded by noxious vermin and venomous insects that preyed on our bodies, and rendered sleep or rest difficult; nevertheless, with all these annoyances to contend against, Nature would assert herself, and when overcome with weariness we could sleep, and habit at last made stoics of us, and we became reconciled to every discomfort. Wounds are difficult to heal in the tropics, and some of the men got lock-jaw and died ; some from very simple wounds. Luckily our commander got better. The lady of the hacienda was very kind to him, and nearly every day she sent him some dainty or present, which was turned over to the men, for Ryan scarcely touched any food while he lay unwell. As soon as he was able to go about he became more exacting in matters of discipline, and the men were obliged to be more orderly. There were stated times for everything, and though

They leave the town just after the sun is up and return before sunset, in order to avoid the miasma which rises chiefly before sunrise and immediately after sun down.

Nine months were yet to come of most exacting ser vice in the trenches. During the forty long, weary days which had now closed there had been no day in which the men, if not actually engaged in fighting, had been beyond the sounds of artillery and musketry, and day by day the list of casualties had grown larger and larger. The line upon which General Grant had determined to fight it out if every day of all the summer time should witness a battle was crimsoned with blood, from the Rapidan to where the deadly miasmas lingered around the sluggish waters of the Chickahominy. The sum mer was lost in autumn, autumn in winter and the winter broken by spring before the line had come to an end and the battle had ceased to rage. There was a promise of respite from the daily sounds of car nage. It was fifty miles by the safest route and surest crossing of the James to the destination fixed upon. The enemy was to be deceived by a feint toward Richmond from the direction of White Oak Swamp. Should this deception succeed, the ex posed flank was secure from attack, the march safe from inter ruption. To the point where the end sought for was to follow (47D

They had all sat to me, much against their inclination ; but Tjou, having become my friend, insisted on their complying with my request. He made his wife and daughter-in-law understand that they were to stay quiet in front of me as long as it should be necessary. The first, who was very young, near-sighted, and lazy, appeared totally indifferent, and continued sewing during the sitting. The other made faces and grumbled the whole time. As for the young lady, she was quite afraid her portrait would not be taken, and inquired when I should be able to do it. I achieved " Mrs. General's " portrait on the sly, as no one dared order her about. These women re sembled our farm-servants both in their manners and in their dirt. The young girl had itch on her hands, and probably all over her, as she scratched herself un mercifully. I spent a whole morning drawing their little court yard, which was so narrow and darkened by overhan<nno roofs that fresh air and sunlight never reached it. The air was foul and charged with miasma, and I could never have remained in it without my cigar. It was not surprising that the health of the inhabitants was un satisfactory. That day they ate their dinners whilst I was there. The little boy awaited the meal with impatience, and kept on askino whether they were not going to begin soon, to which the " General " replied that he should have no dinner at all if

Wherever any dry land is found on the banks of these rivers, there are established native towns ; and opposite these are moored the hulks in which the traders live. Some of these hulks have been fine vessels in their day, and all are very comfortably fitted up and roofed over : the finest is that of the African Steamship Company, the "Adriatic," which formerly belonged to the White Star Company, and is now moored in Bonny river. Morning after morning the Europeans doomed to a wretched existence in these floating prisons wake up with a feeling of weariness and depression, and look out daily on the same muddy river with its banks of reeking ooze and inter- minable mangrove swamps. At night time the miasma creeps up from every creek and gradually enfolds all objects in a damp white shroud ; while the croaking of the bull-frogs, the cry of a night-bird, and the lapping of the restless tide against the sides of the hulk, are the only sounds that break the oppres- sive silence.

Now none of these things are conducive to health in such a climate as that of West Africa, and they might all be avoided by travelling, say from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., when the sun has been drying the forest all day and drawing up the miasma, while no dew to speak of has begun to fall. Should there be no moon, a native torch, made of dry palm-stems, can be manufactured anywhere in a few minutes ; and the only objection I have ever heard urged against choosing this time for journeying is that it is not pleasant to enter a village, and have to choose a hut to sleep in and prepare the evening meal, so late ; but this is easily reduced to a minimum by sending on your boys an hour ahead of you to prepare for your arrival. It is not as if there was anything to be seen during a trip to the bush, for few people, who have not experienced it, can understand the loathing with which one regards the endless monotony of the forest, through the dense rank vegetation of which one moves on day after day, as if between two lofty walls of foliage, without seeing a single glade or break in the sameness.

It is true that the weather during April and May is often very bad at Davos ; but the invalid has always his warm hotel in which to remain on bad days ; and I cannot feel sure that he would be much better off at any one of the places which I have here mentioned as being almost the only alternatives. The only other places that I know of as being likely to be approximately suitable for the required purpose, are Bex or Aigle in the valley of the Rhone, both* of which are situated at an elevation of about 1,400 feet above the sea, and in the midst of beautiful scenery. There are excellent hotels at both of these places, situated at some distance from, and at a con siderable altitude above, the villages which are in the valley, and well above the mists which hang over the river in the early mornings and evenings, and which give the valley such an unenviable reputation for miasma. I believe, however, that, for some reason or other, neither of these places is strongly recommended by the medical men at Davos, though I should have preferred them to any of the places above mentioned. Davos is not a difficult place to get to from England. It is distant less than thirty miles from Landquart, which is on the line of railway between Bale and Coire, and about forty miles from Coire. Ddigences run between each of those places and Davos daily, the one from Landquart in about seven hours, and the one

The appearance of the town of Banias is somewhat peculiar, for on the top of each flat roof the inhabitants erect wicker- work cages of oleander boughs, and stand them on four upright poles. These can only be reached by a ladder, and are used as sleeping-places at night ; the villagers hoping by this device to escape the scorpions and other insects which abound here during the summer heat. The people are said to suffer much from ague. A poisonous miasma rises from the marshes of Huleh in the autumn, and makes the place, fascinating though it was to our eyes, very unhealthy. It is noAv generally supposed that it was on a spur of Hermon, not far from Banias, that the transfiguration of our Lord took place.

For this reason the growth of the South de pended largely upon the number and intelli gence of the slaves, and a man's wealth was reckoned as much by the negroes he owned as by his rice-fields or cotton-plantations. Great attention was paid to the raising of strong, healthy negroes, as these always brought a better price in market ; and as the years passed, it was found that America produced so many slaves of her own, and public opinion grew so strong against importing negroes, that the foreign slave-trade ceased except where it was carried on by smuggling. But slaves were still bought and sold in America, going from plantation to plantation, village to village, and State to State, never a day passing that did not see, somewhere, families broken up and friends separated forever. The new generations of slaves that grew up on the plantations knew of no other life, and in many cases were merry and contented, fearing

But this had occurred many years before — so many that nobody living was able to mention the date of the occurrence. The base of the hills had 16,000 olive-trees ; but these were deficient in many places. Considerable work had been done in former years to rear up a costly solid aqueduct in masonry to carry the water all round for the irrigation of the olive-trees, and also to drive the oil-mills ; but some of these works had been suffered to fall into dilapidation, many years elapsing without any attempt being made to repair them, or preA'ent the water running to waste. LXI. The flat piece of ground called Huerte Majara, upwards of 200 acres in extent, which received the water after it had been used for the olive grounds, and thus became ATery rich and productive, had been brought into cultivation Avith English ploughs ; but from want of efficient ploughmen the experiment had failed, and the luckless ploughs Avere left to rot or rust beside the high-road, ready to be carried off by any one who might take a fancy to them. A small capataz's, or farm labourer's, house had also been built upon the spot, but those who had tried to live in it had been attacked by fever, from the miasma to

003500552	003500552_68	MY OWN THEORY. 42 I have observed this phenomenon all through Cyprus, and in places where there are larger rivers a certain miasma must arise from the marshy subsoil. But my own theory about the fever is, that so long as the sun and bodily exhaustion through fatigue or fasting be avoided, one will escape it. It is a simple theory, perhaps ; but it is the theory of actual experience and personal trial. To my own exemption from any attack, I can add additional proof in the case of the officers of the Forty-Second. They had tents as the soldiers had ; but each one of them was careful that his tent should be pitched under the shade of a tree, the pole upright in the very centre. Thus placed, they were almost completely hidden, and no sun could possibly penetrate through the thick foliage of the carob. Thus, as I have said before, only one officer fell ill during the stay of the regiment in Cyprus — Mr. Fitzroy Hay, a son of the Earl of Kinnoul. When he came to say goodbye, on the evening before he left Kyrenia, he seemed painfully thin and suffering ; and we heard that the fever clung to him even in the complete change of air which England afforded, and that it was some time before he became his old self. It is true that later my husband suffered from a slight attack, as the result of a hot ride in the sun to Nicosia. Pasquale and Balnearnes (the soldier servant left with us when the Forty-Second departed) were also attacked. But in all three cases I was able to trace the illness either to over-fatigue or exposure to the heat, the avoidance of which unquestionably secured my own immunity.

Nature, how ever, is not to be blamed for this drawback to one of her most charming creations. With better drainage and cleanlier habits amongst its popula tion, there is no reason why Rio should not be a perfectly healthy place. To exorcise the demon who annually scourges its people, no acquaintance with the black art is necessary. The scrubbing brush and Windsor soap — " this only is the witch craft need be used." Four days after leaving Rio we arrived at Monte Video, but as we came from an infected port we were put into quarantine, much to our disgust, and were of course unable to go on shore. After we had discharged what cargo we carried for Monte Video, we proceeded to a little island, where we were to land the quarantine passengers, amongst whom was my brother Queensberry, who wanted to stop in Monte Video for a fortnight, following us by the next steamer. The quarantine island, which was a bare rocky little place, did not look at all inviting, and I certainly did not envy my brother his three-days' stay on it. He told me afterwards

Observe, that before I have been in Syracuse two days, I have traced out with my own eyes the localities of three of the greatest wars in Grecian story — that of the Athenians, in the siege of Syracuse, under Nicias and Demosthenes, at Epipolœ and the Great Harbour ; of the Carthaginians, under Himilicon, upon Plemmyrium; and of the Romans, under Marcellus, upon the heights of the Outer city. I can also understand the pestilent miasma, predicted by the Delphic oracle, which con taminates Syracuse on the land side, and ruins it as a permanent residence, spite of its lovely climate. In all times, an enemy encamped on the low land bordering the harbour was doomed. The Syracusans might fold their hands and sit idle ; death did their work for them, and did it quickly. Readers of Thucydides, Plutarch, and Diodorus, know this for themselves. Those who are not readers, I inform that the shores of the Great Harbour, except on the rise of Plemmyrium, where the sun never seems to shine, are altogether swampy water-meadows and salt works.

The whole brood of Cyclops and Titans seem escaped from Etna, to fight their battles with gods over again, amid the Cartha ginian tents ; the earth trembles, and pale funereal lights play upon the horizon. It is said by the priests in Syracuse, and the rumour gains ground day by day, that Jupiter and Demeter, in their wrath, have given over the African host to destruction. A pestilence breaks out. It begins among the light-clothed Egyp tians encamped in white tents along the ridge of Plemmyrium, passes to the Libyans and Nu midians on the plain, and, from these, spreads over the whole Carthaginian fleet and army. This year the summer heats are long and excessive. In the marshy ground about the harbour, the morning sun brings forth poison ous vapours, to be dried up by the heated miasma of the burning noon. Dry winds raise up showers of dust, which penetrate the hot skin, poisonous insects abound, and lack of rain dries up the foun tains. It is for this moment that Dionysius has waited.

In such a community a cultivated man would starve ; for he must have books for himself, and the effect of books on others, to create an atmosphere wherein he can breathe growingly. The disease of a practical materialism prevails, wherever on the globe gold has been able to make itself into heaps ; as though by the friction and jingle incident to the piling of coin of this metal were generated a miasma that strikes right into the heart of mankind. In a Belgian city, whose highest class — highest by wealth, by inherited title, by acknowledged position — is self-isolated, with the ordinary outlets choked up by individual apathy, aggravated by the insignificancy of a small State, and with the contractions of a purely Romish education and surroundings — in such a city, whose upper circle buries itself in itself, this saffron dis ease, this moral jaundice is, through the stagnation of the social atmosphere, petted into chronic obsti nacy and fatality. By the growth of population, the growth of wealth, the growth of ideas, and the diffusion of knowledge, the nobility as a governing class has

Often scurvy sores would gangrene, and maggots would crawl from the flesh, and pass from the bowels, and, under the tortures of a slow death, the body would become, in part, putrid before death. In this manner died Corporal Gibson, an old, esteemed, and pious man of my company. Two or three others also died in much the same manner. Corporal Gibson especially had his reason and senses clear, after most of his body was in a putrid condition. In other cases, persons wasted to mere skeletons by starvation and disease, unable to help themselves, died by inches the most terrible of deaths, with not a particle of medicine, or a hand lifted by those in charge of the prison for their relief. There was a portion of the camp, forming a kind of a swamp, on the north side of the branch, as it was termed by the rebels, which ran through the centre of the camp. This swamp was used as a sink by the prisoners, and was putrid with the corruption of human offal. The stench polluted and pervaded the whole atmosphere of the prison. When the prisoner was fortunate enough to get a breath of air outside the prison, it seemed like a new development of creation, so different was it from the poisonous vapors inhaled from this cesspool with which the prison air was reek ing. During the day the sun drank up the most noxious of these vapors, but in the night the terrible miasma and stench pervaded the atmosphere almost to suffocation.

Its situation is unfavorable for commerce on account of the inconvenience of communicating with the Goletta which is its main port of entrance ; and it is also unfavorable to health on account of the miasma from the lake into which the sewers of the city have flowed for more than two thousand years. In these two points of view the site of ancient Carthage has decided advantages. Tunis contains the city proper (El Medina), and two suburbs, one north of it and the other south. 40

On the north and west, Algeria and Senegal have become, in the hands of the French, points of attack in the direction of the great desert of Sahara, which reaches the boundaries of their possessions. In this direction they at once encounter the most inhospitable part of it, the Sahel, a vast sandy arid plain, dotted with a few rare oases, and inhabited at different points by tribes justly dreaded for their cruelty. It was a French traveller, Caillie, who, starting from the Senegal, first visited, in 1828, the mysterious city of Timbuctoo on the Niger, on the southern borders of the Sahara. After him, Leop. Panet travelled along its western border from St. Louis to Mogadore by Aderer (1852). More recently still, in 1859, one of the most learned geographers of our time, H. Duveyrier, explored with exceptional success that sea of sand in which so many dauntless travellers have perished. There, in especial, died in 1869, murdered by her escort, a woman whose

At its exit from this second lake, the river, which is there 1443 feet broad, takes the name of the White Nile (Bahr-el-Abiad). It crosses an uneven country, and its bed is strewed with rocks, which, with the rapids, forbid all navigation. It receives a multitude of affluents, the principal of which are the Bahr-el-Gazal on the left, and the Sobat, which descends from the Abyssinian plateau, on the right. From Gondokoro, the Nile continues to be navigable : but here commences a marshy hollow, which, in the rainy season, converts this region into a vast lake covered with impenetrable reeds. The putrid miasmas which arise from these submerged and hot lands, have made numerous victims amongst travellers and missionaries. Beyond the point of junction with the Bahr-el-Gazal, the Nile takes its northward direction, but not without describing many curves ; it is dotted with islets and floating masses of vegetation as far as Khartoom, where

It is a common occurrence to find a hole two or three feet deep in the very centre of the roadway, where the timber has rotted away. Tobolsk is, therefore, not a desirable place for night excursions on wheels, for, save on moonlight nights, the lower town is in almost total darkness after sunset. Tobolsk is very unhealthy, owing to the proximity of large stagnant marshes, productive of fever and miasma. The winters are severe, the summers dull and rainy, the sun seldom being seen at any season. It is the most cheerless, depressing place in Western Siberia. Many prisoners say they would prefer ten years at the mines to two here, although it is so much nearer European Russia. The population of this city is estimated at

In summer the heat, dust, and flies are intolerable ; in winter the sun is seldom seen. There is no amusement of any kind — no cafd, no band, no theatre, to go to after the day's work. This seemed to distress the poor Parisian exile more than anything, more even than the smell of oil, which, from the moment you enter until you leave Baku, there is no getting away from. Although the wells are fully three miles away, the table-cloths and napkins were saturated with it, and the very food one ate had a faint sickly flavour of naphtha.

Small-pox, typhus, and typhoid are never absent, and every two or three years an epidemic of cholera breaks out and carries off a fearful percentage of the inhabitants. In spring-time, during heavy rains, the plains are frequently inundated to a depth of two or three feet, and the water, stagnating and rotting under a blazing sun, produces towards nightfall a thick white mist, pregnant with miasma and the dreaded * A similar case happened not long ago in Southern Russia.

On account of the river being full of water, and favoured with a beautiful moonlight, the boat kept on up the stream.

The ordinary route from the river Magdalena to the interior town of Bucaramanga is by means of canoe on the river Lebrija, but, in my desire to get a sight of the South American forests, I left for the time being these more frequented ways and determined to take the path directly through the forest ; and with that intention, after three days' journey, I left the steam boat at a small village called Puerto Wilches, situated in one of the most luxuriant and beautiful parts of the valley of the Magdalena. The entire settlement consisted of about two dozen miserable huts. The people by their swarthy colour appeared to be half Spaniard and half Indian. They live in a situation where the land is so rich that with the least exertion it would produce two or three crops yearly. In their mud-huts the very barest

From the station named a very swampy country with clumps of trees was passed, the breeding place of the malaria, which renders the sea-coast region here most unhealthy. Wood, cut for fuel, lay piled near wooden shanties built on piles some feet above the damp ground, as shelters for those engaged in the lumbering operations -carried on hereabouts. In other places, where the soil was cultivated, the habitations were similarly constructed in order to avoid its miasma. The ride along the coast was very pleasant, and turning a curve we came at last in sight of Batum, presenting a far different appearance than it did when it was a Turkish town of only seventy odd houses, for it now had sufficient dwellings for its 14,000 inhabitants, many of which were sub stantial buildings. In fact, so changed is it for the better that, taking other than a view coloured by politics, we could not but regard it with satis faction. On our arrival we drove to the " Hotel de France," and learning that the Austrian Lloyds'

A very nice pony was offered me for Rs. 40, but I was too far from the riding point to take him, and it was well for me I declined him. Murree, though 7000 feet above the sea level, is not considered a remarkably healthy place; indeed there had been a very severe course of cholera there in 1888. And in looking over the grand view I have spoken of, I could not avoid a misgiving that it must be sometimes invaded, when the wind sets that way, by miasma from the not too distant flats. The weather also is apt to be very unsettled at times ; and so I found it while there, though I secured a pleasant ride or two to Pinnacle Hill and other spots. The scope for excursions is, however, limited. It was in fact bad weather that prevented my leaving before Saturday, the 13th of April ; for in the night of the 9th we had a very heavy thunder storm, accompanied with that grim and ghostly phenomenon, a high wind in the dark. Nay more, there was snow ; ay, and a small shock of earthquake into the bargain was felt by all of us in the course of the night. The next two days were but little better, and bad reports of the roads came in, large landslips being announced. However, on Saturday, the 13th, as I have said, I came away in my tonga, notwith standing all misgivings, and reached the station of Domel for the night. The road descends rapidly from Murree towards the River Jhelum, which flows through the Vale of Kashmir and falls into the Indus. Almost immediately after leaving Murree

It lies directly south of Manila Bay, and its capital, Calapan, is distant about a hundred and twenty miles from Manila. Nowhere in the northern Philippines is there an island so little known, or one so universally avoided by white men. The natives frequently refer to it significantly as the " white man's grave." At the present time it is celebrated chiefly for the un savoury reputation of its people, the heaviness of its rainfall, and the deadliness of the miasma in its fever smitten lowlands. There was a time when Mindoro was famous for other things. So much rice was formerly raised along the coast as to cause the island to be named " the granary of the Philippines," and the population of the numerous coast villages seems to have consisted chiefly of peaceable, law-abiding Tagalogs. All this has long since been changed. The prosperity of the civilized natives served to attract the attention of the Moros, who repeatedly raided their towns, rapidly thinning the population.

To get into these houses you have to ascend a flight of steps from the outside, so that you are literally always living upstairs. Running along the front of the house is the verandah, or gallery. This is sometimes open, but more frequently closed in with three or four windows and jalousies. These jalousies are an arrangement of wood made on the principle of a Venetian blind, which you can open or shut at pleasure. When open they let in the breeze, at the same time excluding the sun. When closed they exclude both rain and light. The gallery, or verandah, is the coolest part of the house. There we sit and meet our friends, the pleasant cool breeze fanning our cheeks and modifying the otherwise oppressive heat of the sun. A tropical house has, of necessity, many windows. The one I am now writing in has thirty ; some have twice that number. These windows are, for the most part, wide open during the day, letting a current of cool air blow freely through every room. In England we are accustomed to see chimneys on the top of every house. Who would think of building a house without a chimney ? But here the houses are without chimneys. We do

Inland the shape of the recess is continued, though on a larger scale, as if the sea should have run further inland, and it is bordered by an amphi theatre of hills. In the arena, so to speak, of this amphitheatre there is a railway, tropical bush in which is a cocoanut grove, and a swamp from which a dense miasma nightly rolls up like smoke. The cocoanuts gave nectar to the soldiers, and the railway could soon be used, for the Spaniards left many cars, two engines (from which only the piston-rods had been removed), and many tons of coal. Siboney bore many marks of the bombard ment. Clean holes had been whipped through the iron of the railway bridge, and the wood work had flown in splinters. Many houses had been burnt to the ground ; of others the wrooden walls were drilled with holes, or the iron roof had been brushed here and there into a feather by a skipping fragment of shell. Outside the door of one house flour lay on a flat board, and

The climate is dry and tonic throughout the year, and during the season when travelers are there — from Novem ber to the end of March— these characteristics are more observable than in summer. Violent varia tions of temperature are unknown, and sunshine prevails even to monotony. It may truthfully be said that the Nile valley is as bountiful in rest and recreation to the invalid as in matchless sights to the tourist. That the natural conditions will suit all health-seekers would be a statement too com prehensive for a lay writer to venture. But the ailments that would be benefited by a winter passed rationally on the banks of the Nile greatly out number those that would not. The word " miasma " has no place in the vocabulary of Cairo or Upper Egypt. The annual rainfall in Cairo is scarcely more than an inch and a half. This means, perhaps, but three

The farmer, who formerly lived where I met with the brick-maker, used to take charge of horses during the time of sickness, and received so much per month for the care of them. They were located on the summit of this mountain. The air is so salubrious that none of them died. This horse-sickness is often exceed ingly fatal. It is much dreaded by farmers, both in the colony and many places beyond it. It probably arises from some miasma in the low grounds, as in a higher atmosphere the animals are preserved in health. We had not proceeded far, before our wagon got into a somewhat deep and troublesome sort of quagmire, where our hinder wheel got fixed half-way up. We had to dig away earth in front of each wheel, and to make a petty embankment, to keep the water out that came slowly along from the neighbouring hills, and formed just here a deeper pool than we found convenient. We then lifted nearly all our goods out of the wagon, and by that means lightened our cargo ; so we got safely up on the bank, but it detained us four hours. Then we outspanned again, and took our midday refreshments. We had not gone much more than an hour forward, when we met with a second delay. We came to a stream where the bottom seemed too soft and unsound to admit our attempting to cross it. We proceeded a little higher, hut there found our oxen and wagon entangled in the labyrinth of a vlei or bottom — a low swampy ground, impassable in the rainy season ; and now impassable, though perfectly dry and hard, from the nature of the ground. The water had been absorbed in narrow cuts or channels, so that, over a vast extent of the field, on each side of the central water course, there are innumerable elevations and depressions. At about every two yards' distance is a new gutter or dry ditch, into which the oxen kept plunging, above their knees, and would then go no further. The wagon also got jammed in. The animals became frightened, and would

Often were we aroused by the clatter of branches of sunken trees against our canopy, and as often lulled to repose again by the rocking canoe and rippling stream. It being the dry season, the early part of the night was free from dews and fog ; but as morning approached, the miasma from the shore was op pressive and offensive in the extreme. At this hour we were also aroused by the most extraordinary sounds, produced by monkeys, iguanas, and some of the larger varieties of the feathered tribes — the latter producing a noise resembling the violent collision of two stones under water, while the former seemed to have filled the forests with Chinese gongs innumera ble, and thousands of steamboats, high and low pressure, blow ing off steam in every direction. Beginning at a long dis tance, these sounds roared around us till echo herself was confounded. We welcomed the morning light as it quickly dispelled the mist ; and the rising sun displayed to our view the little village of Dos Hermanos, (or Two Brothers,) where we landed, and were speedily engaged in discussing our breakfast, con sisting of thick black mud and water called cafe, which was not too hot to allow the dogs occasionally to stir it up with their noses. " Throw physic to the dogs" exclaimed one and all, as we turned our attention to claret and water for a time, and a coarse set of ragamuffin biscuits as a stay for our stomachs. This day we got our fowling-pieces in order, and obtained some wild turkey — numerous here but quite small ; a species also of wild peacock, some blue and white heron, besides hav ing a shot now and then at long distance for monkeys, parrots, and other birds nameless and unknown. Approaching near to shore at mid-day, we saw on the sedgy

The enceinte contains a vast terre pleine of parallelo grammical form, in obtaining earth for which the large tank below the ruins was probably excavated. Within the masses of masonry, many of which, shaken by time or earthquakes, have faUen into fantastic shapes resembling at a distance huge red rocks, there is Scindian desolation : a hard surface of dry kahgil — the mixture of clay and chopped straw used as plaster in this part of the world — thickly sown with bits of vitrified brick and tile, a broken wall or two, and a domed tomb converted by the pigeons into a dovecot : by these things we know that man has been there.

Upon his reappointment, he removed to Salina, where he continued to reside, until his death, in 1832. The few adventurers, who up to this period had dared the inhalation of the pestilential miasma of the marsh, and were willing to wade through its mud and water, in attempting to earn a scanty pittance for themselves and families, had usu ally but little pretension to that intelligence or refinement of intellect and manners which so peculiarly distinguished the individual who had been chosen to protect the public interest and collect the revenue to be derived from this invaluable fountain, which in its subsequent and still extending develope ments, has already caused the building up of a wealthy and populous town. As it respects Dr. Kirkpatrick, it might well be supposed that the singular and strongly marked transition which had occurred in his life, from the polished and intellectual society in which he had previously moved, to the cheerless and almost semi-barbarous condition of things then existing at Salina, would have had the effect of producing disgust and despon dency on his part. But this was not so — he entered upon the discharge of his new duties with alacrity of spirits and kind feelings. He lost no time in making himself acquainted, not only with the present state of the manufacturing operations, but also with the persons employed in the business, and he took early measures to increase the State revenue, by judi cious improvements, whilst he was disposed in every way in his power to aid the worthy and industrious manufacturers. During the whole life of Dr. Kirkpatrick, after his remo val to Salina, he continued to cultivate his literary taste, by an intimate reading of all the standard works of the day, and particularly of the English and Scotch Reviews, for the great er part of which he was a regular subscriber; indeed, to works of this character, he devoted a large portion of his leisure time. He was of a joyous and pleasant temperament, and delighted to sit down with friends of his own habits of

Sometime after the agreement was made, 'Akil returned and expressed a wish to be released. I ascertained that some of his timid followers had been dissuading him, and held him to his obligation. He is a high-toned savage. At our former meeting I advanced him money for his ex penses and the purchase of provisions, for which he refused to give a receipt or append his seal (an Arab never subscribes his name, even when he can write) to the contract. I had, therefore, nothing but his word to rely upon, which I well knew he would never break. " The bar of iron may be broken, but the word of an honest man never," and there is as much honour beneath the yellow skin of this untutored Arab, as ever swelled the breast of the chivalrous Coeur de Lion. He never dreamed of falsehood. During the early part of the day the weather was plea sant, with passing clouds ; but when unobscured the sun was warm. Towards the afternoon the wind subsided, and the calm sea, when the sun shone upon it, verified the resemblance which it has been said to bear to molten lead. In the forenoon it had looked as yesterday, like a sheet of foam. The night was clear, a thin mist hung over the southern shore, and moon was nearly at the full. Near us, when all was still, the sea had the exact hue of absinthe, or that peculiar blue of the grotto of " Azzura," described in the " Improvisatore." Until 2 A. M. the night was serene and lovely. Although the earth was fine and penetrating as ashes, and the miasma from the marsh anything but agreeable, there were no fleas, and the bites which had so smarted from the spray yesterday, are now heahng up.

We therefore hastened back to our inn, and in the comfort of its neat snug parlour, and the very excellent fish dinner provided by our host, soon recovered our wonted cheerfulness. To our enquiries during the meal we were informed, that previous to the introduction of the branch rail to Canterbury, Whitstable was apparently a scene of greater trade and bustle, being in fact the port for the trans mission of coal and merchandize from the port of London to Canterbury, and of corn, hops, and other agricultural produce to the metropolis. The facility of the present conveyance by rail has in creased its trade, but the busy scene of cart and waggon traffic no longer exists. The dredgers, in their picturesque costume, now the oyster sea son has commenced, add greatly to the gay ap pearance of the place, and between seventy and eighty vessels were lying in the offing to convey their cargoes to town. Indeed it was this little fleet that seduced us to land, lighting up, with all the bright tints of the rainbow, the surrounding objects on either side. Whitstable also possesses some valuable salt works, and many persons are employed in dredging for a particular kind of stone, used in the com position of cement, having been previously burnt and pulverized. The miasma, engendered by the marshes, does not appear to affect the natives of this unhealthy district, and we were not a little

His com plexion was much lighter and clearer than that of the great majority of the Westerners, who, from the miasmas engendered by the extent to which vegetable decomposition is still going on in the soil, have generally a dark, sallow, bilious fever and aguish look about them. He had a small black eye, as quick and rest less as that of a ferret. Nothing seemed to escape his observation. He first made himself familiar with every thing on board, then with everybody, and lastly gave his attention almost exclusively to external objects. Every glance which he bestowed upon you had the deep prying curiosity of a first look about it ; and you could see, as his eye roved over every object from the deck to the horizon, that the mind kept up with it. He had nothing of the quiet, brooding melan choly and cunning look of the genuine Yankee about him ; for whilst he observed everybody and every thing, he did not seem anxious to escape observation, or to lead the judgment astray in attempting to fathom him. As he paced the deck with a confident, though by no means insolent air, I watched him for some time with the interest which attaches to a fine speci men of a noble race of animals, my admiration being divided between his herculean proportions and his manly, independent bearing. It was not long ere I got into conversation with him, although to do so I had to make the first advances. I found him shrewd, intelligent, communicative, and inquiring. He was a red-hot Oregon man, and almost gnashed his teeth with rage when he spoke of the treaty which had

Such ground was useful for growing paddy, but as the water graduaUy evaporated, leaving a bed of fetid black mud, thickened with decayed vegetation, and exposed to the rays of an October or November sun, a pestdential miasma was the result. Moreover, it is evident from the compound slope9 of the country, that the waters derived from the river might in many cases have been returned to it in a purified state. Thus some httle would be done towards remedying the evds complained of in the Indus, — shaUowness and an over deposit of sdt. 2nd. The faulty shape adopted for the canals, and the perseverance displayed in adhering to that form. The banks were perpendicular waUs of sdt or stiff clay, and when undermined by the water, they readdy fell in. The excavated earth was disposed of in an im mense and ever-mcreasing spod-bank close to the canal, so as to obstruct clearance, and give the work men as much trouble as possible.

The main trunks, as the Fuladee, Goonee, and other beds, which, generally speaking, are the courses of dried-up rivers, were rarely, if ever cleaned out, on account of the expense and trouble of such works. The consequence was, that in cold weather they were choked with drifted sand, and every inundation sup plied them with an additional coat of sdty deposit. The effects of this neglect were severely felt at the tads of those streams. In some cases, as in the Rain

Surely this receptacle of abomina- tions could not have existed in its present state during the reign of Maria Theresa. It is impossible to believe that one, whose days may be counted by the noble and beautiful works with which she adorn- ed her empire, could have passed to her imperial creation at Schonbrunn within reach of this black and noxious stream, and suffered its unhallowed waters to flow between the wind and her regality. AVhatever be the cause of its present state of inde- scribable impurity, more striking here than it could be near any other city7, from the remarkable cleanli- ness of Vienna in all other respects, — whatever be its cause, it must have arisen since this most noble lady took her last drive beside its unsightly shores ; for had such vapours as nearly suffocated us yesterday been permitted to reach her from its tainted waters, I feel persuaded that, before twenty-four hours had passed, five hundred diggers and delvers would have been seen deepening their shallow bed, and drawing from every brook that poured forth a wholesome current in the vicinity, wherewithal to Supply such a stream as might be worthy of giving its name to imperial Vienna.

With spring, we are accustomed to associate soft airs, a mild sun, a fair heaven, a green and freshly-budding earth. But with this Italian spring, we are compelled to associate storms, and clouds, and blasts, and hail. ' O, this is an extraordinary season,' says the Italian, as in the month of May, muffling him self up to his chin in his cloak, he flings one corner thereof cavalierly over his left shoulder. ' This is a very extraordinary season. It is no good criterion of our usual spring.' Alas for the traveller of 1836. Many volumes and voices had spoken to him of the beauty, and health-giving properties of an Italian atmo sphere. He has obeyed his resolution to make trial thereof — and now, his skin, nerves and muscles, and many-remembered aches, and remembered fevers rise up, to rebuke those volumes and those voices. When I reflect upon the multitudinous discomforts of Italian travelling ; the desolate dullness of vast apart ments ; the death-giving dampness of beds ; the un drinkable water ; the un-eatable meals ; the miasmas of marches, and the nerve-piercing blasts from moun tains, I am a little inclined to surprise, that Ameri cans should hither travel, for the purpose of wooing back departing health, or of confirming a constitution never yet marred, in vigor and elasticity. But while I am thus reflecting, the hail-shower has ceased ; our vettura has ascended a hill ; an exclama-

The most common diseases are dysentery, diarrhœ, consumption, elephantiasis, intermittent and miasma tic fevers ; small-pox is not an infrequent disease, notwithstanding the extensive vaccine establishment. The products of vegetation in Ceylon are numer ous and valuable. The fruits are the mango, the pumplemose, pummalo, or shaddock, the orange, the pine-apple (a wild species said to be poisonous) bananas, &c. ; but neither European fruits nor vege tables flourish on the coast. At a new settlement called Newura Elba and at Kandy, potatoes of very good quality have been produced for several years. Rice, the chief article of native diet, is grown, but not in sufficient quantity for the consumption of the Island; the average annual importation from 1819 to 1828 inclusive, was 1,251,680 parrahs (the parrah of rice being from 42 to 46 lbs.), equal to 870,784 bushels ; one-third more than the annual importa tion under the Dutch administration.* Yet, that the island can be made capable of producing suffi- * A brief appeal to the Government of Great Baitain in behalf of the Inhabitants of Ceylon.

But its piano is a spacious rock-em bosomed plain, one sea of ever-living leaf and fruit, that flows in waves of richness and of verdure high up Hie surrounding hills, white-wailed villa and sunny town scattered here and there, like wild swans, among its curves and hollows. The semi circle of higher hills beyond — where grow such flowers and such plants — forms an arc, to which the shore, which is three or four miles in length between the forelands, is the chord, and as the piano shelves, by a slight declivity, from the hills to the cliffs, diving there sheer down in deep precipices, you are enabled to see from any part of its slope, as from a theatre, the whole of the marvellous sce nery of the gulf spread out before you. As to the natives they are rogues of course, but kindly-natured still, I think. They certainly have much suavity of manner, albeit I have heard men say, that they can exhibit no little of the old Greek impertinence upon occasion. They can be as pert and as saucy as a secretary of legation, I heard said by one who knew something of both. The salubrity of the Sorrentine air is accounted for by some by the emanations of nitre from its soil. Perhaps a better solution is in its dryness. I think I have observed that a volcanic soil is either most healthy, or most unhealthy, as it is dry or damp. This plain is all volcano, though some of the rocks around it are calcareous, but, from its elevated position, it is lifted above all miasma, besides that, the glens that intersect it, through h 2

They are a reckless people, light hearted, light made, and hardy. With their high cheek bones, narrow eyelids, projecting chin and lips, and smoke-dried complexion, they are far from being a handsome race. But, to use a homely phrase, they have a "rough and ready" look about them; march and fire very well ; have an uncommonly keen sight ; rival North American Indians in tracking an enemy by his marks, though several days old, on the ground and on the bushes ; are indifferent to the shelter of tents ; can eat six pounds of meat and two of bread at a sitting, and then, with the assistance of a girdle, go three days without food ; and, in short, are excellent mate rials for light troops, and are rapidly trained to war, whether on foot or on horseback. The Dutch burghers are generally very tall and lusty men, subsisted from their youth up wards on mutton, and living in one of the heal thiest climates in the world, which is totally free from marsh miasma and contagious disorders. When called out for the defence of the colony, they go into the field usually with a couple of horses, one of which they ride, and the other they lead. On this last is strapped a vel kombaars, or sheep-skin blanket, to sleep in, some trifling

As we approached, the first thing that struck us was an intolerable odour, which exhaled from the shore at the base of the hills. We found it to proceed from the remains of different animals which were thrown there, and rotting in various stages of putridity. To add to the revolting effect of this, we were told that it had been the spot where the Greeks were generally mas sacred. During the ferment in Smyrna the year before, nearly eight hundred unfortunate victims were dragged to this place, and assassinated in cold blood. Here, as in Constantinople, the Turks had favourite spots for taking away human life, and, as if to show their contempt, they perpetrated the deed among the carcasses of dogs and horses. Through the mouldering remains of this Golgotha we recognized human bones mixed with those of the inferior animals, and we hastened to leave a spot rendered frightful by the atrocities committed, as it was dangerous from the foul miasma generated under a burning sun. As we passed it we met some Turks, who seemed disposed to be more than usually rude and ferocious, addressing us in a coarse and boisterous manner, and discharging their pistols close beside us, as if the recollection of their cruelty had ren dered them more brutal in the vicinity of the place where it had been indulged. As we ascended the hill we found it encumbered with the remains of walls. Neither ruins nor coins have much interest with me unless they illustrate some event, and then, as they are the auxiliaries of history, they become no less interesting than important. Here are the ruins of a sta dium, a temple, and a fortress still standing. The two first are marked by a striking event. The church is that of St. Polycarp. He was the disciple of St. John, and the first bishop of Smyrna appointed by the infant Christian church, not long after the death of Christ. After living to

And this is not im possible, for it seems to have been very long and narrow. Pliny calls it " Lumen Asiæ," but St. John said that " its candlestick should be removed;" and it is so. While Smyrna yet remains a large place, the only substitute for this magnificent city is the little village of Aysiluk, in which reside about one hundred Turks, who cultivate part of the rich plain, and two Greeks, a gardener and a coffee-house keeper, who are all the Christian remains of this most splendid ofthe Seven Churches of Asia. After continuing the whole day among these very interesting remains, till we could see no longer, we returned on board by the way we came in our boats, bringing with us some curious but excellent fish from the weir in the river. And here take a note on the subject of malaria. In addi tion to many verbal, written, and printed warnings which I have had on this subject, our friends at Smyrna charged us to be on our guard against the Plain of Ephesus, the marsh miasma of which, as all say, depopulated the city and country more than the sword or barbarous policy osman. Now, we not only continued on this Plain for two days, but we were compelled to remain a whole night on the very worst and most dangerous part of it, exposed to cold and damp, after heat and relaxation, without covering or refreshment of any kind, sinking in soft bog, and inhaling the dank and putrid exhalations of rank mud and decaying vegetables. Yet of eighteen persons so exposed not one felt any other effect from it than increase of health, appetite, and spirits ! I leave it, however, to your better judgment to decide how far the extensive fires corrected the dangerous quality of the air, and the engagement of our minds the susceptibility of impressions on our bodies.

Whatever opinion be entertained of the result of these experiments, there can be but one as to their mo tives. A more intrepid or disinterested devotion of self in the cause of humanity is not to be found in history. No thing could abate his conviction of non-contagion and the absurdity of quarantines. I met him with a broken con stitution, hastening to his last home, but he was still as sanguine as ever that he would live to benefit the world, by some extraordinary improvement in the management of this terrible distemper, and he died, I was informed, in this firm conviction. Whether any other person will have courage to follow in the footsteps of my philanthropic, but rather eccentric friend, remains to be seen. There is no cause in which humanity is more deeply interested. I was a witness to its breaking out seven times in the course of my residence at Constantinople, and every time it created the same terror, confusion, irrational precaution, and unchecked mortality. A new accession was now made to the diplomatists of Pera by the establishment of an American mission. The existence of an American continent was a thing scarcely known to the Turks in general. It was a place rather too remote for their comprehension, and was veiled in a cloud of obscurity, like some distant undefinable object, which might furnish a theme for a story-teller, but was not alto gether a place to whose existence a true believer was bound to attach much credit. But though America was thus slightly known to the Turks, Turkey was well known to the Americans, and the active and intelligent people of the west ern continent had been long endeavouring to establish diplomatic and commercial relations with it. This attempt was made during the administration of Washington. Mr.

The climate of Erris, situated as it is on the Atlantic is generally mild and salubrious ; snow seldom remains a week even on the highest mountains ; along the shores it almost immediately melts away. Hard frosts are also very rare, but storms are very frequent, and the naked state ofthe country, without trees, hedges, or shelter,gives pernicious effect to them, sometimes to the destruction of the entire crops. In the mountains, no Cattle, except milch-cows or young weak calves are housed, and the general equality of temperature is surprising. In summer, the breezes from the sea make it agreeably refreshing ; in the winter, the wind, though high, is not cold : coming off the great ocean for a great part of the year, it carries with it saline particles, which produce asthmas and consumptions. Dysentery is a frequent complaint, and typhus fever has often made desperate ravages, particularly in the dirty crowded villages, where the miasma, produced from rotten fish-heads and entrails, could not fail to cause it. The people of Erris are not generally subject to scrofulous complaints, which, considering their general food, is rather surprising. Upon the whole, the population are remarkably healthy. We find in the statistical table of the peninsula, (page 58) after two years of great distress and priva tion, only 236 deaths, in a population of near 9000,

Although the lower classes are most frequently the sufferers, on account probably of their filthy habits, yet some of the noblest and wealthiest families in Russia and Poland are not exempt : the Jews, who in these countries are perfect idolaters of dirt and oil, are likewise very often its victims ; and it is a fact, that persons with a blonde complexion and light hair seldom exhibit it. Neither is it hereditary in families of this description. Every instance I myself witnessed was in persons of dark hair and sombre complexions, and more melancholy specimens of suffering humanity I never beheld : they appeared as if in the last stage of a consumption, cadaverous and emaciated. I regret to say, that little hope can be entertained of its eradication ; for under some circum stances, and to certain constitutions, it is contagious, and decidedly hereditary. On these two points I made the most minute inquiries, which were invariably answered in the affirmative. When propagated by contagion, it appears in eight days, and in some instances even in three or four : in such cases it is invariably preceded by a violent fever, head-ache, noise in the ears, &e. ; but when self-en- VOL.

' Your exit, my dear Mrs. Sykes,' I continued, ' seemed like a dream — I could not realize it. Such an irreparable loss ! I thought of all the remedies that had been applied in such cases. Had any thing been omitted that had a tendency to increase the circulation of the radical fluid 1 There was the Galvanic battery, — it had been entirely overlooked, and yet what won- ders it had performed ! No sooner had this occurred to my mind than I was impressed with the conviction that you were to revisit this mundane sphere, and that I was the chosen instrument to enkindle the vital spark. No time was lost in obeying this mysterious impulse. The grave was opened, the batterv was applied secun- dem artem — and the result is the restoration to society of our beloved Mrs. Sykes.' In proportion to her hor- ror at the idea, that she must have rested from her la- bors but for my skill, was her gratitude for this timely rescue. She fell on my neck and clung like one de- mented, till a gathering frown on the face of my spouse warned me of the necessity of repelling her embraces. Mrs. Sykes was now desirous of returning immediately home, to restore as it were to life her bereaved con- sort, who was no doubt mourning at his desolation, and refusing to be comforted. But here 1 felt it my duty to interpose. ' My dear Mrs. Sykes,' said I, 'your re- turn at this moment would overwhelm him. The sud- den change from the lowest depths of woe to a state of ecstacy, would consign him to the tenement you have just quitted. No! this extraordinary Providence must be gradually unfolded.'' She yielded at last to my sage

The inundated state of the country is the less inconvenient, from the most picturesque roads having lately been cut all round the hill, about half way up, and nearly on the same level ; and its insular situa tion was also obviated by a strong bund having been thrown across a wide nulla, connecting it with the main land. The summit of one of the ridges is cut down and levelled ; affording a parade ground about an acre in extent, of an oblong square shape ; which adds very much to the comfort of the station, and is the usual place for recreation. The jutting position of the hill always secures for it the fresh breezes ofthe river ; and as the prevailing winds are either up or down the stream, and the reaches are several miles in extent, it is but little influenced by any febrile miasma. The height protects it against the intense fogs that brood during the night on the plains, which at daylight give the country beneath the appearance of being flooded by the river, and which do not ascend the hill till after sunrise. The hill is rich in copious springs of the finest water, but the natives give it no pre ference to that of the Brahmaputra. The lines of the Seapoys run in a winding though horizontal manner along the bold eas tern brow of the hill ; two terraces having been cut out of the solid clay for that purpose, and at very great labour ; for there is so little level land upon the hill, as to render cutting indispensible. This work, as well as the roads upon the hill, was performed by the prisoners ; and occupied them several months. The position is one of the most
002307440	002307440_116	104 TOPOGRAPHY XII name of marsh fever ; that the inhabitants who live contiguous to them are more liable to ague than others, where no marshes exist ; that stran gers on visiting marshy districts are attacked with ague, that they would elsewhere have es caped ; that marshes may be deprived of their miasma by being drained and cultivated ; and that cultivated lands may become noxious by being kept in a state of inundation. That Cal cutta now is so much more healthy than it was in former years, has been chiefly indebted to the draining of its marshes and jeels, and cutting down jungle ; and that cultivated lands may be almost depopulated by inundation, was manifest ed in the awful mortality from fever, that fol lowed the great deluges of Balasore and the 24-Pergunnahs, bordering on the sea, of recent years ; sweeping away thousands and thousands of the population. The station of Hansi, in Upper India, is another instance of the genera tion of fever from an excess of irrigation. The country around Hansi is naturally dry and arid, so much so that it was found necessary to con vey water from a great distance by canals for the purpose of cultivation. Hansi was at one time and previous to the formation of canals a healthy station, but from the excess of irrigation, the country has become a perfect nursery for fevers, and is nearly uninhabitable. Hence also is the reason why the months of August, Sep tember, and October, are so eminently unheal thy. In these months the periodical floods are subsiding, the country is covered with sheets of water evaporating to dryness and abounding with decaying vegetation, each pool of which is a
002307440	002307440_117	105 OF ASSAM. XII 5 Rice Fields, 6 Tanks & Pools, source of fever. During these months the in habitants of many malarial countries fly from their homes as they would from certain death, nor venture to go back till the unhealthy sea son is over. The Tarai along the foot of the Hi malaya mountains, theRunnat the mouth ofthe Indus, and the Sunderbunds of the Ganges, are in a great measure deserted in these seasons, few remaining exposed that can effect their escape. Many parts of the interior of India are in these months insulated by tracts of jun gle, and no one who is aware of the conse quence, or values his life, would willingly ven ture through them. During the months of May, June, July, August, September, and October, the jungles of Assam, are imminently unhealthy, and no European ought, if possible, to venture beyond the limits of Cantonments. The same laws that operate in rendering marsh - es miasmatic, also operate though perhaps in less degree in the rice fields of Assam. Towards the end of the rains, and while the fields are still flowing with water, the ears are cropped and the straw is allowed to remain to ferment and form miasma. This is not a visionary idea, for so strong is this belief that rice fields produce mias ma that in many places on the continent of Eu rope, and far less favourable to the development of malaria than India, the laws of the kingdom prohibit the growth of rice for that very reason. But marshes and rice hhates are but two of the many sources of malaria to be seen on every hand in Assam. Every native of rank has a o

Jungle, nursery for fever in the immediate vicinity of his house, called a tank or pond, and every poor man a pit or a pool, which seem as if made on purpose to supply them with miasma, as well as with muddy water and water lilies. I do not mean to attribute any blame to tanks and ponds if kept properly clean ; they would then be both useful and ornamental : but from the weeds and jungle that in most cases are allowed to infest them, they exert the most baneful effects on the constitution of the inhabitants. If the ditches of Fort William were allowed to remain filled with stagnant water, and become a field for studying the botany of reeds and rushes, its pre sent healthy character would speedily leave it ; and were the numerous tanks throughout Cal cutta, left to nature to overgrow with weeds, the consequences would be truly melancholy. Another hot bed of malaria is the quantity of underwood and jungle with which most native habitations are choked up, so impene trable as to form a barrier to all encroachment from without, and a screen through which the eye of curiosity cannot penetrate. But this belt of jungle is also the seat of malaria, and the better it answers the purpose intended by its owners, the more concentrated is the malaria which the dense mass of vegetables that die every season engenders. These belts of jungle are pregnant with another evil ; they are the usual resort for performing the calls of nature, and the effluvia from the daily deposit of so much filthiness comes in for a large share of the ill ness entailed upon the household.
002307440	002307440_119	107 OF ASSAM. Another cause of fever is the total disregard XII. to ventilation in native houses. It is well known 8. that a close confined atmosphere is the most ventilation. favourable place for the action of malaria, and that nothing dissipates it so readily as a current of fresh air, but in native houses the doors are few, the windows still fewer, and both seem con structed on purpose to admit as little of the vital air as is consistent with the smallest possible quantity of light ; and these are for the most part obstructed with mats or screens. Moreover, the premises are frequently surrounded by a lofty wall or matting, which with the trees out side, render it almost a matter of impossibility for any useful ventilation to take place. This same obstruction to ventilation is seen on the grand scale around almost every town in Ben gal. The suburbs of every large city resembles a dense forest more than a habitation proper for human beings. Even the City of Calcutta is surrounded with a cordon of populated jungle that must be obnoxious to the inhabitants of its palaces, and the salt-water lake may be consi- dered as a grand depot of fever. Another cause of miasma is the quantity of Ru^ed ruined houses, and deserted grounds around the Houses. ruins, with obstructed drains and decaying trees. I am afraid these are but too little thought of as injurious, even by a European Police. Having stated the principal sources of malaria Pred™p0nent I shall next mention a few of the many causes £frusesof Fe" that render the constitution susceptible of its

But when the traveler forsakes the valley of the Ohio, and advancing westward, ascends to the level of that great plain, which constitutes the general surface of this extensive region, he finds himself in an open champaign country — in a wilderness of broad plains, covered with a rich sward of grass, and destitute of trees. The transition is as sudden, as it is complete. Behind him are the most gigantic productions of the forest — before him are the lowly, the verdant, the delicate, inhabitants of the lawn ; behind him are gloom and chill, before him are sunlight and graceful beauty. He has passed the rocky cliff, and the savage mountain pass, where the den of the rattle snake is concealed, — the marshes that send up foetid steams of desolating miasma, — and the canebrake where the bear and the panther lurk ; and has reached the pas ture where the deer is feeding, and the prairie-flower displays its diversified hues. He has seen the wilder ness in all its savage pomp, and gloomy grandeur, arrayed in the terrors of barbarian state ; but now beholds it in its festal garb, reposing in peace, and surrounded by light, gayety, and beauty. This distinction is not imaginary ; no observing man can pass from one part of this region to another, without remarking the natural antithesis to which we allude ; and that mind would be defective in its perceptions of the sublime and beautiful, which did not feel, as well as see, the effects of this singular contrast. There is in the ap pearance of one of our primitive forests, a gloomy wild ness, that throws a east of solemnity over the feelings , a something in the wide spread solitude which suggests to the traveler that he is far from the habitations of man — alone, in the companionship of his own thoughts, and the presence of his God, But the prairie landscape

Early in the summer all the streams except the largest, are dried up ; the traveler is astonished as he passes over deep channels, perfectly dry, to see, by the marks of water above his head, that immense floods have recently filled them to overflowing, and at finding in the beds of rivers of sounding name, in which for months together a ship of the line might float, rivulets almost exhausted, over which he could jump at a single bound. Wet prairies occur where the surface of the plain is perfectly level, or slightly concave. A very small pro portion of the whole country is comprised within this de scription ; and all of it may be easily drained. We have scarcely ever seen a prairie from which the standing water might not be conveyed by a ditch a few feet in depth. They are not sufficiently extensive to produce any effect upon the atmosphere ; and as the waters are rapidly evaporated, they become dry in the early part ofthe sum mer, and are covered like the other lands with grass ; so that they do not generate miasma in any quantity which can perceptibly effect the salubrity of the air. The quality of the water in the interior, or prairie re gion, is often made a subject of complaint by travelers. The reason is obvious. The first settlers in a new coun try, and those who keep the houses of entertainment at which travelers stop, are persons who care little for the luxuries of life, and who have been accustomed to the use of spring water. They know little, and care less, about the art of procuring the pure element by means of artificial wells. When obliged to resort to this method of getting water, they consider it a matter of importance to find it as near the surface as possible, or rather, if they do not find it after digging a few feet, they desist and seek it at another spot ; and choice of a place at which to reside, K

Individuals or families establishing themselves at one of these hotels, have time to look about them before they finally settle, and should they be destined to travel to the Upper Provinces, they cannot do better than take up their abode in them during the whole of their sojourn at the Presidency. Though the rents of houses have fallen considerably during the last few years, they are still high in Calcutta, and indeed all over India, and when persons expect to be settled for any long period, it is advisable to purchase ; the health and comfort of a family depending greatly upon improve- ments and conveniences which are not always to be found in a hired house, and for which a tenant-at-will does not like to incur the expence. There are many very respectable man sions in Calcutta, and indeed throughout Bengal which are only glazed on what is called the weather-side, and which are entirely destitute of fire-places, the latter though very conducive to comfort are not perhaps absolutely essential, for although the weather is frequently very cold, by shutting up the doors and windows and by having tin feet-warmers filled with hot water, an agreeable temperature may be kept up, but the glazing should never be dispensed with. During the continuance of the typhoons or squalls, (which are of common occurrence both in hot and rainy seasons,) and for some hours afterwards, until the sky has become quite settled, the house should be closely shut up, especially at night, the elemental disturbance affecting the air very con siderably, and producing the most injurious results to delicate persons unaccustomed to such exposure. The large Venetian blinds though shutting apparently very closely, admit damp air loaded with miasma, and if strict enquiry were made into

During the hot winds in the Upper Provinces many per sons sleep outside the houses with perfect impunity, the air being perfectly dry, but this indulgence can only be enjoyed in particular places, and at particular seasons of the year, the moment that any change in the state of the atmosphere may be expected, it is dangerous to the last degree. Persons impatient of heat are apt to dispense with their musquito curtains under the idea that they prevent the free circulation of the air. It is never advisable to relinquish this protection, slight as it may be, from the miasma with which the atmos phere is frequently loaded, the moisture which is often found on the outside of these curtains showing how much they tend to preserve the party sleeping within them from actual contact with baleful influences. To those who can afford it the best plan is to shut up the bedchamber entirely, and have a punkah pulled all night, but this luxury is only to be obtained at present at the expence of keeping extra servants ; when machinery shall be more extensively introduced into India, the residents will be enabled to keep punkahs constantly going in every room in the house at a comparatively small expence, a blessing of most inestimable importance in such a country. Few persons sleep in the hot weather with more than a sheet over them, though a greater degree of coolness is secured by excluding the hot air by means of a thick coverlet. The contact with clothes is certainly very dis tressing during hot nights, and great comfort would be produced by having the sheet and counterpane extended over a framework at about a foot and a half or two feet dis tant from the body. The natives who are well aware of the danger of exposure to the atmosphere when sleeping as they often do, in the open air, always take care to wrap them selves up from head to foot, having acquired the method of
002303579	002303579_309	298 SKETCHES OF they pursue their labours : and at length getting out of all patience, (for the natives will say, " Plenty of time, massa, to-morrow come aster to-day,") he will set his own crew to work, and ply them with plenty of rum to excite their energies : and it is no wonder if, especially in the hot season, their strength be soon prostrated under the dreadful effects of an African fever. It ought to be a constituted law of the Gambia, that no British seaman be allowed to ascend the river during this period of the year ; and we do not see why the humane regulations of government should not include the sailors of merchantmen as well as those of our men-of-war, who are seldom permitted to go ashore. After labouring all day in loading wood, in a narrow creek surrounded with mangroves, where a breath of wind cannot purify the atmosphere, and his strength is perhaps farther prostrated with sensual gratifications which he here indulges without restraint, the seaman in vain endeavours to sleep during the night in the open air ; in the cabin he cannot breathe, on account of the myriads of torment ing musquitoes with which he is assailed. Or should exhausted nature sink into repose in spite of these torments, he is still exposed to the marsh miasma, which exhales abundantly from these haunts of fever. And so it is with the missionary. He sees a wide field of action before him, and he labours to do all the good that he can " whilst it is called day." His zeal props up his exhausted strength, and he continues to work extravagantly upon this moral excitement, until disease supervenes, and his exhausted frame sinks under

From the position of Nauplia in respect to the rest of Greece, this place may be styled the Gibraltar of the Aegean sea. From the latter the view of Nauplia is finely picturesque, especially in the fairer state of the vernal clime of Greece ; but he who would preserve the dear illusion, is advised not to step into the town. The houses incline to ruin ; the streets are narrow and filthy ; and therefore the habits of the people cannot much assimilate with purity and decorum. A modern Hercules might cleanse the streets ; but what shall brush away the ungenial miasma, exhaling from the adjacent marshes ? With my friend Masson, I spent some hours in conference on the state and wants of Greece, and after my return to Malta I sent up to him, still at Nauplia, a large box of the Greek Pilgrim's Pro gress, with other books for circulation. I also paid my respects to Prince Mavrocordatos, now at the head of affairs. He was meditating an attack on Patrass. We had much conversation, surrounded by his suite of attendants armed to the teeth. The prince had his arm in a sling, having been wounded; but to me it was shrewdly remarked that this sling was a mere feint, to postpone or put aside altogether the unwelcome day of battle. Prince Mavrocordatos, or Black-heart, as the term imports, received me very politely, and appointed a soldier to protect me through the rest of Greece. One day a number of poor fellows, who had been wounded in battle, came into our apartment to have

Though Dr. K.'s house was at some distance west of the marsh, he often in the summer, during an east wind, felt — that is, smelled — the malaria, which arises thence, ancl has been compelled to shut both the balcony-doors and the windows. The Resi dent, who is very enterprising, w7ished to drain this unhealthy spot ; but as much labour and expense were required, it w7ould necessarily be some time ere his plans could be effected. In the Edinburgh Review, it has been stated, " that wherever marshes are situated near a large city, the intervention of woods must necessarily form a screen, to impede the wafting of the miasmata by the winds. Perhaps (it adds) this might have been the reason why the ancients consecrated the woods in the vicinity of Rome to Neptune, in order to se cure them from the axe." .... M. Rigaud de Lisle, in a Memoire on the physical properties of malaria, observes: " Near St. Stephen's, on Mount Argentel, a convent is situated, which wTas formed for the salubrity of its air ; but since the forests which sur rounded it have been cleared, it has become un healthy.

In addition to the valuable and direct medical testimony we have adduced on this question, we will now lay before the reader a selec tion of facts of a general nature, from which it will be evident, that injuries arising from these marshes to the public health are not merely subjects of professional curiosity, or so hidden and occult in their operation, as to be cognizable only by a nice professional criticism, but are of such magnitude as to form a matter of general notoriety. As a proof of the general deleterious tendency of the miasma of the putrid marshes, whether in producing fever and other contagious disorders, or in aggravating the wounds of persons exposed to its in fluence (to which latter circumstances Mr Liston has borne direct testimony), we lay before the reader some information, which we have extracted from a letter addressed by Mr Rankin, the manager of the Leith branch of the Dalkeith and Edinburgh Railway, to Alexander Macaulay, Esq. Windmill Street. The following facts have come under Mr Rankin's own observation, and are worthy of serious at tention, exhibiting as they do the diseased state to which working people in that locality are so unnecessarily exposed. " Many of the workmen," says he, " employed in doubling the line of the Leith Branch Railway through the irrigated meadows, grew very sallow, some quite yellow, as if they had jaundice, and several left the work from sickness and never returned.'' We quote, in the preceding paragraph, the precise words which Mr Rankin himself uses, because they pourtray so exactly (and, as we believe, quite unintentionally on Mr Rankin's part) the precise diseased appearance which is exhibited by the inhabitants of all those countries where the presence and action of a deleterious marsh poi son is doubted by no one. Thus, Dr James Johnson, a distinguish ed living medical author, and physician extraordinary to his late Ma jesty William IV., remarks, in his work " On Change of Air :"
000035847	000035847_370	350 EXCESSIVE HEAT MARSHES. may the people be short-lived, since every breath they inhale is charged with poisonous miasma, and all the vapours around are noxious with putrid vegetable and animal matter. The thermometer stood at 106° in the shade. The earth had a fiery red tinge, and where there was moisture all vegetation was rotten, and where there was no moisture everything was parched. The glare was insufferable, es pecially to my eyes, which were grievously afflicted with Egyptian ophthalmia. This glare was heightened by the refraction from the sea and sky, aided by that from the sandy beach, and sent back as if by a mirror from the face of the precipices bounding the plain. To protect my eyes I put on spectacles, but the metal became so heated that I was obliged to remove them. Metal buttons even became burn ing to the touch. When I closed my eyes, my eyelids were blistered with the hot glaff, which felt like a blast from the mouth of a furnace. The lofty range of the Taurus moun tains presents no opening here to let the current of heated air pass as if through a funnel. The sea breeze is thus stopped in its advance to be roasted as if in an oven, and the heavy masses of vapour, hitherto driven before it, sink and settle down on the marshes in white mist, and impede the land breezes in the rear. Everything therefore, and everywhere, becomes feverishly hot, stagnant, putrid, loathsome, and pestilential. About a hundred years ago the Levant English Company established a factory at Scanderoon ; and it is said that more Englishmen died here during the continuance of their charter than have died in the whole of Syria for a century. Four months was reckoned a long period for a factor to survive. The churchyard is hard by the harbour, surrounded by a

And within it there lies the mortal remains of many a poor Englishman, who landed in youthful vigour in the laudable expectation of returning home with a fortune. The inhabitants, natives as well as Europeans, have an un earthly yellow tinge. Their countenance is not only like that of a corpse, but it is like that of one which had been buried for a time. Their whole frame is dried and shriv elled. Their sunken and sullen look show-s that death al ready sits on their eyelids, as it did with Job. The seeds of fever are sown on every feature. They have no appetite, their spirit is gone, and their vigour hath ceased. Intense anxiety broods over their mind. Stooping, and ever looking downward, they never seem to smile, and they seldom speak. And when they think at all, it is only of their agonies and agues. Should a traveller once happen to notice the Scan deroon expression of countenance, he will at once recognise it wherever he sees it again. There joined us off Scanderoon, the night we left it, the Medical Superintendent of the quarantine there. He had only been resident for a few weeks, and he kept company with me up to Constantinople. But had he escaped half hanged from a gallows he could not have looked more horrid. He was seldom a minute entirely free from ague and anxiety. He had no appetite, and his bowels were dreadfully disorder ed. He served quarantine with me in the same apartment for five days at Smyrna ; and we sailed for a thousand miles together in one steamer after another, and during that time his whole conversation was about infection, miasma, diar rhœa, and death. He was amiable and gentlemanly, and very well-informed ; but to say the least of it, neither the

The Grand Council, or rather their representatives, had met to con coct plans for various nefarious enterprises, and among them the wholesale robbery of the negroes of Mr. Hen derson, an absent planter, by his overseer. Stewart, now regularly inducted into their plans, secrets, and signs, being entirely satisfied with regard to the plans of Mur rel, became naturally desirous to escape ; and under the pretence of having left, by mistake, some valuable papers at the house of a Mr. Erwin, obtained leave of the chief to return there, upon the condition that he would await his own arrival before departing for home. The Mr. Erwin to whose house Stewart returned, was one to whom he had confided something of his hazardous enterprise and of Murrel's character. Besides Erwin, he had also informed two other persons upon the road, and all of them entered fully into his plan. One, a Mr. Haynes, promised in case of any emergency, or of his not returning at the appointed time, to raise a company of fifty armed men at half an hour's notice, and take the field to capture Murrel, and such of his gang as he might find. With Erwin, Murrel had contracted to deliver three negroes at a certain price, and Stewart had, before cross ing the river, arranged with his host to lead the pirate on to the completion of the contract, and have him arrested after the slaves had been received and paid for.

The natives of the country well know the value of quinine, which is called by them sidfato ; but it is beyond the reach of poor people, and many have given fabulous prices for carbonate of magnesia, or other white powder sold under the name of sulfato. The Kurds use a strong decoction of sumach leaves, which produces violent vomit ing and purging, and often cuts short the fever. Many other substances, producing a great shock on the system, will produce a like effect. I am not aware that chemists have succeeded in isolating the poison of endemic fever. Some have supposed it to be produced by moist and decaying vegetation, fermenting under a burning sun — a state of things doubtless existing in marshes ; but during my travels I have met with the worst and most intense form of this fever upon a dry sandy soil, destitute of any vegetation beyond a few sparse camel-thorns. The land had been flooded in the spring, and had dried up rapidly under a tropical sun, and a tribe of Arabs encamping there were decimated. A thoroughly wet marsh I believe to be harmless ; but there is always a dry border exhaling dis ease. It may be asked if there be any preventive agent to be employed by those who go into dangerous places. It is most difficult, indeed logically impossible, to prove anything to be a preventive ; but I have strong faith in

These States would, without the negro population, lose much of their most picturesque, most peculiar life ; besides which, they could not dispense with negro labour. It is declared that rice, cotton, and sugar could not be cultivated without the negro, who is habitu ated to the heat of the sun, and to whom it is a delight. The white man dies of the heat and the miasmas which are produced by the soil; the black man, on the contrary, flourishes there, increases and multiplies, or merely suffers slightly from climatic fevers. When the circum stances are favourable between the white and the black, it is evident that there exists no inimical relationship between them ; they love each other and are attracted to each other ; equally unlike, their respective deficiencies perfect nature. The good-tempered, cheerful negro loves the grave, sensible white man, and allows himself to be guided by him, and he, in his turn, loves the good hearted black man, and allows himself to be tended by him. I say nothing, but what noble and thinking men in the Slave States consider to be possible, when I state to your Majesty the conviction that the noblest, because the most difficult, future endeavour of the Slave States ought to be the converting of one portion of its slave population into free labourers. I say one portion, because it is clear that merely one portion thereof would be capable of remaining, as free men, under American dominion. The portion of the slave population which longs to go to Africa should go there ; and that portion which is attached to the soil and the people of America, and which is capable of acquiring its cultivation and its active laborious spirit, should remain in its Southern States, where it has been brought up, to which it belongs, by nature, habitude, and affections, and where the colouriug and the romantic life of these lauds, beloved by the sun, would be greatly increased by their life of labour on the plantations and

Beneath these verdant, leafy arches which overshadow the water lie the peaceful tortoise and the cruel alligator also, waiting for its prey. Elks inhabit these natural temples, also panthers, tigers and black bears. Around these columns of leaves and flowers wind the rattlesnake and the poisonous mocassin, and that beautiful, romantic forest is full of small, poisonous, noxious creatures. But more dangerous than all is the pleasant air which comes laden, during the summer, with the miasmas of the primeval forests and the river, bringing to the colonist, fever, and slowly consuming diseases ; and causing these wondrously beautiful shores still to lack human inhabitants. Small settlements have been commenced here and there on the river, but have, after a few years, been deserted and left to decay. It is, however, precisely this primeval life in the wilder ness, this wild luxuriant beauty defying the power of man, and vigorous in its own affluence, which is so unspeak ably interesting to me, and which supplies me with an incessant festival. And the air is so pleasant, and the magnolias so full of flower, the river so full of life, alligators and fishes splashing about, large and beautiful water-fowl on all hands ; everything is so luxuriant — so wonderfully rich, wild, and lovely — it is a never-ending fairy scene ; especially in the evenings when the moon rises and throws her mystic half light and half shadow into the arches and pillared aisles of these marvellous natural temples. I sit in silence on the piazza, and gaze upon it with devotion and rapture, as, at every bend of the river, new and striking scenes present themselves ; happy when I can thus sit alone, or with my good Mrs. W. H. at my side, in company with whom I am always right. But we are not without our little disturbing occurrences.

This decision was most disastrous to the unfortunate beneficiary. The good fathers of the church of Mary, incensed beyond mea sure at the fickleness of purpose which had cost them so much, condemned the poor lady to remain in purgatory for ever and ever, while the friars of the church of Jesus, being in receipt of nothing for good offices, have not felt called upon to take her out. To make her punishment more signal, and at the same time to convert her folly into a lesson, the holy fathers of the former church have put her in this iron cage, " and poor creature," concluded my guide, " she is now burning, burning, burning, worse than any poor devil who never gave a scudi to the cause of Christ !" " Between the two stools then, she fell to the ground," said I, musingly. " Yes sir," added the guide ; " and I believe there is something in the proverb which says, that 'one better have the devil for his friend, than have none.' " Upon this, we issued from the church and resumed our carriage to set out for the Capitol, on Capitoline Hill. Be fore leaving the Piazza del Popolo, however, I should not omit to give it credit for a fine Egyptian obelisk of brown stone, of great antiquity, brought from the Heathen Temple ofthe Sun at Heliopolis, but now consecrated at its summit by a Christian cross. Neither should I forget to mention my guide's warning, that the Piazza del Popolo and its vi cinity is generally subject to malaria during the summer months, and is by no means a place to promenade in after night-fall, when the pestiferous miasma descends upon the earth. Indeed, he informed me that it was not safe for a stranger to be anywhere abroad in Rome during the torrid

But to return. There are some twelve houses and cabins built or in progress of erection. The population of this place is from seventy-five to one hun dred souls. It is a strong Pro-Slavery town, and furnished a large quota — nearly sixty men — to the Governor's forces for " the War." It has a steam saw-mill of eighteen horse power. The citizens claim to have had no cases of that great Western bug-bear, the all shaking fever and ague, as yet ; but we should say that the location, with the large swampy bottom in its vici nity, was favorable to the production of swamp miasmas. Franklin is distant by some thirty-eight miles from Westport, Mo., fifty-five from Independence, three from Lawrence, and fifteen from LecomptOD, the capital of Kansas Territory. We are indebted to Mr. Stewart, our fellow traveller, for much useful data in re Kansas and her prospects. The following "facts and figures," which have been derived in part from the gentleman just alluded to, and others well qualified to give accurate information, may, we think, bo regarded as reliable, and, we trust, prove useful to those who contemplate " moving into the Territory." These calculations, it should be remarked, will apply equally well to a large portion of Eastern Kansas. Day laborers command $1 35 per day and find themselves ; mechanics from $1 75 to $2 00 per day, without board ; wash ing — as there is a lack of females as yet — is high, say$l 25 per dozen; single-team wagons — calculating the average day's travel at twenty-five miles — may be had at from $4 50 to $5 00 per day.

No sooner was I within the walls of the building, than I found that the utmost elasticity of spirit was indeed necessary, to withstand the depressing effects of the intense cold and filthy wretchedness of the place. At all times cool, owing to the great thickness of the walls, the cold of the Portuguese churches in the early spring, when the outer air is just begun to be heated by the sun, is of a cutting intensity I cannot pretend to describe ; it appears to pene trate to the vitals. From a hot pavement, on a July day, to an ice-house, is the only comparison that can be made, and it fails in strength to typify the contrast. The exterior of the church has a multitude of quaint and curious masons'' marks, and fragments of inscriptions in ancient Latin. In several places it would seem as though some building or monument, covered with a long inscription, had been taken down, and the stones used again indiscrimi nately, without regard to their original position. A want of sufficient leisure prevented me from making even a selection of them. The floor of the church, as usual, had certain spaces, the size of a grave, boarded only ; the rotten and ill-fitted pieces of wood, yielding to the pressure of the foot. Withered leaves and faded garlands encumbered the floor and filled the corners. The air, loaded with animal and vegetable miasma, was thick and choking. Such was the lower portion of the church ; and satisfied with having very hastily made a rubbing of a curiously-impious brass in the wall, I ascended to the gallery at the west end — rickety, decayed, and dirty — the shaken and broken plaster falling as I passed. It was here that the organ was situated — it was here the choir fulfilled the offices. The organ ! Exert

Alas 1 no angels ; only little black babies, toddling about with an older child or two to watch them, occupied the aisle. At the upper end was the owner's mansion, with a circular court-yard around it, and an irregular plantation of great trees ; one of the oaks, as I afterwards learned, seven feet in diameter of trunk, and covering with its branches a circle of one hundred and twenty feet in diameter. As I approached it, a smart servant came out to take my horse. I obtained from him a direction to the residence of the gentleman I was searching for, and rode away, glad that I bad stumbled into so charming a place. After riding a few miles further I reached my destination. A RICE PLANTATION. Mr. X. has two plantations on the river, besides a large tract of poor pine forest land, extending some miles back upon the upland, and reaching above the malarious region. In the upper part of this pine land is a house, occupied by bis overseer during the malarious season, when it is dangerous for any but negroes to remain during the night in the vicinity of the swamps or rice fields. Even those few who have been born in the region, and have grown up subject to the malaria, are generally weakly and short-lived. The negroes do not enjoy as good health on rice plantations as elsewhere; and the greater difficulty with which their lives are preserved, through infancy especially, shows that the subtle poison of the miasma is not innocuous to them; but Mr. X. boasts a steady increase of his negro stock of five per
002706930	002706930_431	419 SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA. cent, per annum, which is better than is averaged on the planta tions of the interior. As to the degree of danger to others, " I would as soon stand fifty feet from the best Kentucky rifleman and be shot at by the hour, as to spend a night on my plantation in summer," a Charleston gentleman said to me. And the following two instances of the deadly work it sometimes does were mentioned to me by another : A party of six ladies and gentlemen went out of town to spend a day at the mansion of a rice-planter, on an island. By an accident to their boat, their return before night was prevented, and they went back and shut themselves within the house, bad fires made, around which they sat all night, and took every other precaution to guard against the miasma. Never theless, four of them died from its effects, within a week ; and the other two suffered severely. Two brothers owned a plantation on which they bad spent the winter ; one of them, as summer approached, was careful to go to another residence every night ; the other delayed to do so until it was too late. One morning he was found to be ill ; a physician could not be procured until late in the afternoon, by which time bis recovery was hopeless. The sick man besought his brother not to hazard his own life by remaining with him ; and be was obliged, before the sun set, to take the last farewell, and leave him with the servants, in whose care, in the course of the night, be died. The plantation which contains Mr. X.'s winter residence, has but a small extent of rice land, the greater part of it being reclaimed upland swamp soil, suitable for the culture of Sea Island cotton, which, at the present market, might be grown upon it with profit. But, as his force of slaves has ordinarily been more profitably engaged in the rice-fields, all this has been

VII. 1787, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be deliv ered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due."1 Thus the question of slavery had been presented in a three fold form, and on each the south had carried their point. The legality of slavery in the slave states was virtually recog nized ; the slave trade itself was licensed for twenty years ; and fugitive slaves were to be returned to their masters.2 How far such compromises were justified by circumstances wise men have found it difficult to decide. It should be re membered, however, that, if the measures were wrong, involv ing a sacrifice of moral principle, the north was to blame for sanctioning that wrong, and is justly obnoxious to the conse quences of its misconduct. Ellsworth was no true prophet in predicting that, in time, " slavery will not be a speck in our country." It has multiplied sevenfold, and is, without doubt, one of the most serious evils in the nation. Whether it will ever be peaceably abolished, or whether it will continue to expand and increase, diffusing abroad a moral miasma, to taint and corrupt the whole body politic, are questions which are certainly of vital importance. But may we not hope that a merciful God will open a way, in accordance with the spirit of the gospel of Christ, by which the country may be rid of this evil, without the intervention of a violence which could end only in the dismemberment of the Union, or in an exas peration of seeling which would rankle so deeply as to banish forever brotherly love ? This is the problem for the statesmen of the nineteenth century : who does not pray that it may be happily solved ? To a certain extent the issue is sectional ; nor can this be avoided while slavery exists. The antagonism of freedom and slavery is perpetual. Fire and water are not 1 Hildreth's U. S. iii. 522. These statements are to be under- stood rather of the effects of the meas- ures adopted than of specific clauses in the constitution itself; for not a word about slavery is said in that instrument.

Yet I must plead guilty to an almost childish delight at the thought of an excursion on the water. But such a feeling could only be appreciated by one who, like us, had driven and slept, and nearly lived, in a " tarantassfe" for a month. We are rowing up the bay of Inkerman. Passing on the right hand the careening harbour, some ancient chambers, and a chapel cut in the rock, now used as a powder magazine ; and, from time to time, the beau tiful arcades carrying the aqueduct over the inlets of the bay ; and, on the left, the ruined village of Actiar, the navy baking-house, the white cliff, and the light house; at length we swept into the "Tchernaia- Retchka," here running through a marshy flat of its own depositing, covered with rank vegetation, the prolific mother of miasma. Disembarking at a little bridge, we walked through the nine hundred feet of tunnelled aqueduct, and then visited the great limestone quarries, whence most — would that we could say all ! — of the material for the immense works of Sebastopol were procured. Returning to the valley of Inkerman, here narrowed by two approaching mountains, we found their per pendicular sides completely dotted over with perfora tions of various shapes and sizes ; the doors and win-

At one time, the surface of the earth was, for a few feet, completely illuminated. After watching them for a long time, until the eye was completely wearied, I laid down, when I noticed that the lights were more visible than when I stood up, which might arise from their being so near the surface of the earth, and my seeing under them. In returning again through the same forest, I had another opportunity of seeing the Ignis Fatuus in the same place. It was then a beautiful moonlight night ; but, from the denseness of the forest, little benefit was derived from its rays. In this instance, there were two lights seen hovering over the river, at about two feet from its surface. They were nearly stationary, and shone so brightly, that, although the natives were engaged in fishing with lighted brands, they were not eclipsed. In that neighbourhood there are many large kauri pines, and it is not improbable that the decomposed remains of these highly resi nous trees have had something to do with this phenomenon. The Fens of Ely and Lincoln, were formerly notorious for their unwholsome fogs and miasma, as well as for the frequent appearance of the Ignis Fatuus, which might be seen in all directions every dark night. Of late years, it has been more rarely observed, and during the time I held a curacy in the heart of the Fens,* a period of more than five years, I only noticed it twice. On one of these occasions, a dark, rainy night, in returning home from a distant church in the Fens, I had an opportunity of seeing this singular light. At first, I took it for a man with a lantern, and being anxious to share the benefit of it, as well as to gain a companion, I quickened my step, to get up with him, walking through thick and thin — for the road was deep in mud ; but I got no nearer : the light still kept at the same distance from me. I therefore stood still, and listened whether I could hear any footsteps, and was then surprised to see the light dancing about, from one side of the road to the other : sometimes sinking to the level of the earth, and * Coveney and Manea, in the Isle of Ely, a complete Missionary post.

From the southern frontier of Nubia, where the tropi cal rains begin to fall, to the table-land of Abyssinia on the south, and as far up the White Nile as has yet been explored, Scudan is devastated by fevers of the most malignant charac ter. The summers are fatal to at least one-half of the Turks, Egyptians and Europeans who make their residence there, and the natives themselves, though the mortality is not so great among them, rarely pass through the year without an attack of fever. I arrived during the most healthy part of the year, and yet of all the persons I saw, three-fourths were complain ing of some derangement of the system. The military hospi tal, which I visited, was filled with cases of fever, dysentery and small-pox. I was in such good bodily condition from my journey through the Desert that I could scarcely conceive the sensation of sickness, and the generous diet and invigorating exercise I enjoyed secured me from all fear of an attack. Travellers are not agreed as to the cause of this mortality in Soudan. Some attribute it to the presence of infusoriæ in the water ; yet we drank the pure, mountain-born flood of the Blue Nile, and filtered it beforehand. I am disposed to side with Russegger, who accounts for it entirely by the miasma arising from decayed vegetation, during the intense heats. The coun try around Khartoum is a dead level ; the only mountain to be seen is the long ridge of Djebel Gerrari, twelve miles to the north. Behind the town, the White Nile curves to the east, and during the inundation his waters extend even to the sub urbs, almost insulating the place. The unusual sickness of the winter of 1852 might be accounted for by the inundation of the previous summer, which was so much higher than ordinary that the people were obliged to erect dykes to keep the water

The lengthened stay Avhich the Commissions made on the spot proved, however, the contrary to be the case : continued sick ness pervaded the Avhole four camps ; food could not be retained upon the stomach long after a meal ; and a general state of debility naturally ensued. This could not be attributed to the style of Uving ; because each party follow-ed its own customs :— the Russians took their little doses of cognac, and ate their national caviare, — the English abjured fruit, and the Orientals lived upon it.

I arrived during the most healthy part of the year, and yet of all the persons I saw, three-fourths were complain ing of some derangement of the system. The military hospi tal, which I visited, was filled with cases of fever, dysentery and small-pox. I was in such good bodily condition from my journey through the Desert that I could scarcely conceive the sensation of sickness, and the generous diet and invigorating exercise I enjoyed secured me from all fear of an attack. Travellers are not agreed as to the cause of this mortality in Soudan. Some attribute it to the presence of infusoriæ in the water ; yet we drank the pure, mountain-born flood of the Blue Nile, and filtered it beforehand. I am disposed to side with Russegger, who accounts for it entirely by the miasma arising from decayed vegetation, during the intense heats. The coun try around Khartoum is a dead level ; the only mountain to be seen is the long ridge of Djebel Gerrari, twelve miles to the north. Behind the town, the White Nile curves to the east, and during the inundation his waters extend even to the sub-. urbs, almost insulating the place. The unusual sickness of the winter of 1852 might be accounted for by the inundation of the previous summer, which was so much higher than ordinary that the people were obliged to erect dykes to keep the water

Aye, friendly reader, in every land, in every country where the unhallowed union of church and state prevails, there is a moral and politi cal putrescence eviscrated — a deadly miasma, as destruc tive to civil and religious liberty as the fabled breezes passing from or over the Upas tree are destructive to all animal life ; or, as the boa constrictor's horrid embrace, in a thousand convolutions, wound around the body of its victim, must bring death. Can a people thus circum stanced, thus taught, made to believe "ignorance is bliss," understand and appreciate the just structure of a free government and with an apprentice skill build it up ? Alas! never — never. So true are these statements, the utter incapacity and indisposition of those who, unfortu nately, have been reared and schooled in the monarchies of even the most enlightened portions of Europe, that when come to this enlightened land and privileged to en joy all the guarantees of life, liberty and property of our free constitutions and benign system of laws upon the single condition of conformity thereto, afford ample and sure evidence. The transition is so great it is hard to discipline them to the rational and virtuous pro prieties of the country. Often, too often, with them liber ty is licentiousness. Look at South America! Look at Mexico ! For more than forty years in these, one revolu tion for liberty has followed in swift and most destructive succession after another; all professedly and, we believe sincerely, for civil and religious freedom, and still what is the liberty acquired ? Fearful anarchy, it is true, the worst of governments, has sometimes been brought about; but yet, in every instance of the erection of government", its nature and essence are tyranny and oppression!

If, as is to be presumed, the noxious matter is conveyed through the lungs, it may not be difficult to account for the efficiency of this simple preventive. The nature of these poisons is such that they are easily decomposed, and that by the feeblest chemical agents. It is possible that the heated and compound gas, which proceeds from the lungs, forming an atmosphere within the veil of silk, may have power to decompose the miasma in its passage to the mouth ; it may also be true that the mechanical texture of the silk prevents the transmission of any deleterious sub tance, or that such covering possesses the property of acting as a non-conductor of miasmata as well as of electricity. The streets of Corfu are narrow ; paltry houses are con structed in the Venetian fashion, the lower story supporting the upper by arches, affording shelter from rain and sun. There are several churches, and great festivals observed, especially that of St. Spiridion, the tutelar saint, which it would be tedious to describe. A magazine was destroyed by fire here in 1789, when 72,0001bs. of powder and 600 bomb-shells blew up, and killed 200 men. With respect to education, it may in general be observed, that the name of the earl of Guildford is held in great estimation for his indefatigable exertions to found colleges and other in stitutions in Greece, and here a library of 30,000 volumes was chiefly contributed by that nobleman. As to schools established by him, they excite as much astonishment as admiration ; and the most sincere regret will be expressed his lordship should have died so early in that noble career he had been engaged in, respecting the interests of science, learning, and a rising generation ; but his name will be kept alive in the imperishable page of history, among the other sons of Britain whose labours have been most spe cially directed for the benefit of the human race. My next object was to reach Malta.

Thus, at her felt approach and secret might, Art after art goes out, and all is night." The anti-scientific influences of the principle have, however, not been restricted to the cloisters of the University. They have been creeping of late over the surface of English society, as that sulphurous fog into which the arch-fiend in Milton transformed himself when he sought to dash creation into chaos, crept of old over the surface of Eden. The singularly extended front of opposition presented last autumn by the newspaper press of England to the British Association, when holding its sittings at Southampton, and the sort of running fire kept up for weeks after on its more distinguished members, — men such as Sir Roderick Murchison, Dr Buckland, and Mr Lyell, — seem to have been an indhect consequence of a grow ing influence in the country on the part of the revived super stition. One of the earliest assaults made on the Association, as hostile in its nature and tendencies to religion, appeared several years ago in the leading organ of Tractarianism, the "British Critic;" but the "Critic" in those days stood much alone. Now, however, though no longer in the field, it has got not a few successors in the work, and its party many an active ally. The mediæval miasma, originated in the bogs and fens of Oxford, has been blown aslant over the face of the country ; and not only religious, but scientific truth, is to ex perience, it would seem, the influence of its poisonous blights and rotting mildews. It is not difficult to conceive how the revived superstition of the middle ages should bear no good will to science or its institutions. Their influences are naturally antagonistic.

The ignorance of their guides, and the betrayal of their plan of attack, completed the series of misfortunes which resulted in their overthrow. The season of the year both for land and sea opera tions was the most improper which could have been chosen. Who that is at all acquainted with our coast does not know its peculiar exposures to the equinoxial gales of September? and who that knows our climate, is not aware of the almost certain sickness which during our fall months attacks the stranger, particularly at that period, when camping near swamps and ditches ? The consequence was, that the French officers and troops, both at sea and on land, were continually anxious, restive, longing to depart, fearing the miasma on shore and the hurricane on the ocean. Both came to them too soon, but the destruction of neither, equalled the carnage of the battle. There was a vauntingness at times in the language of d'Estaing, which rendered it too haughty to be brave. His words at his sum mons; — " I have not been able to refuse the army of the United States uniting itself with the king" is a strange piece of diplomacy, for it implies that he had endeavored to prevent it, when his very purpose in coming to Georgia was to effect it. The conduct of the French troops during the siege was exemplary and praise worthy. A generous emulation, and nothing more, pervaded both armies ; and the bravery of the allies needs no greater comment than the number of dead and wounded they left upon the field of battle. Wash ington, writing to General Lincoln two months after this attack, concerning its failure, thus alludes to the

But this lovely creature had her little foibles, and, among others, was a strong desire to obtain a fille de chambre. It was with a view to obtain this appendage of civilized life, that the Canadian had proposed to sack a rancheria ; and I could not help laughing at the droll humor and impudence of the fellow when he divulged to me that such was his desire. The bare idea that a semi-barbarian, who had passed his whole life under no better shelter than a few boughs, or at best a skin tent, and who never spent even his winters in a house, should take a fancy for a female attendant — not for himself, but for the fascinating wife of his bosom — was so intensely ludicrous, that I could not rebuke his barbarity so sternly as I meant to do. Having become satisfied that there were no Walla-wallas in the neighborhood, except those encamped on Feather river, and becoming assured that I could control the evil passions of the few men who had a hankering after Indian captives, I resolved to march to the encampment of old Yellow-Bird. He received us very courteously, and I found most of his party sick, owing to the unhealthy situation of their encampment. The site they had selected was in the bend, just where the Feather river falls into the Sacramento, and a more unhealthy spot could hardly have been chosen. Most of my men, both whites and Indians, as well as myself, caught the ague and fever from this visit up the Sacramento valley, from which I infer that this meanest of all diseases may be apprehended wherever the tule lands border the river. The decomposition of the short-lived tule upon these lands when they are overflowed, generates a miasma which produces that universal malady of new countries. The uplands sloping towards the Sierra, on each side of the tule plains, are supposed to be comparatively exempt from the prevalence of the curse; but until the country becomes more settled, I should prefer to give the

The most horrid stories are told of the inhuman repasts of these poor wretches, and their deadly quarrels for the last remnant of a brother's or mother's body. But the details of such atrocities are too shocking to be dwelt upon, especially as the stories are usually derived from hearsay, and much exaggerated to suit the most depraved tastes. Health. — The high and dry character of Upper Cali fornia, the absence of alluvial bottoms of great extent, the comparative scarcity of timber, and many minor causes which might be enumerated, render Upper California a most healthy country. Most new countries are troubled with ague and fever, and bilious fevers of all varieties ; and I am far from saying that California is exempt from them. On the contrary, there is no doubt that large quantities of her quicksilver will be used at home in the shape of calomel, and the demand for quinine will probably be very lively. But these diseases will be contracted chiefly in the low grounds and along the valleys of the rivers, while the up lands, which compose the greater part of California, will be as healthy as any part of the world. Men who stand all day long in the mud and water digging for gold under tho scorching rays of a summer sun, will be apt to sicken any where ; and as their operations will be carried on chiefly in the fever and ague, and bilious region, the gold diggers cannot all hope to escape disease. There are seasons when the usually healthy portions of the country become sickly. When the rains come pre maturely, and afterwards a " dry spell" sets in, and then the sprino-ing vegetation rots, and the miasma arising from that cause, sometimes produces disease. But this is of rare occurrence, and it is safe to say that California is quite as '25

I make no attempt to investigate the precise nature of such cause, nor do I propound even a conjecture respecting it, as the result of any special or enlarged consideration of the subject ; but my present impres- sion is that it is some form of that unknown local influence or thing, commonly recognised under the name of miasma or malaria, and which operates on the animal system as a poison, producing special modi- fications of function and special changes of structure, according to certain special conditions which, how- ever, are like itself unknown. As the unknown thing which we term malaria or miasm of marshes, under certain circumstances gives rise at one time to simple ague, at another to a fatal remittent fever, &c, and produces at times a morbid enlargement of the spleen, at others disease of the liver, &c. &c. ; so I can imagine that some other malaria or unknown thing or influence, of local origin, may be the cause of ordinary broncbocele, of the aggravated broncho- cele or goitre of the Alps, and also of cretinism. There must be something more than stagnant or impure or heated air requisite for its production, as we find it frequently more rife in the larger than in the smaller valleys, as in the instances of the great vadey of the Rhone and the valley of Aosta, which may be regarded almost as its head-quarters. Mere elevation above the sea, however, does not seem to exempt from it, provided the relations of mountain and valley still characterise the locality.

But when the traveler forsakes the valley of the Ohio, and advancing westward, ascends to the level of that great plain, which constitutes the general surface of this extensive region, he finds himself in an open champaign country — in a wilderness of broad plains, covered with a rich sward of grass, and destitute of trees. The transition is as sudden, as it is complete. Behind him are the most gigantic productions of the forest — before him are the lowly, the verdant, the delicate, inhabitants of the lawn ; behind him are gloom and chill, before him are sunlight and graceful beauty. He has passed the rocky cliff, and the savage mountain pass, where the den of the rattle snake is concealed, — the marshes that send up fœtid steams of desolating miasma, — and the canebrake where the bear and the panther lurk; and has reached the pas ture where the deer is feeding, and the prairie-flower displays its diversified hues. He has seen the wilder ness in all its savage pomp, and gloomy grandeur, arrayed in the terrors of barbarian state ; but now beholds it in its festal garb, reposing in peace, and surrounded by light, gayety, and beauty. This distinction is not imaginary ; no observing man can pass from one part of this region to another, without remarking the natural antithesis to which we allude ; and that mind would be defective in its perceptions of the sublime and beautiful, which did not feel, as well as see, the effects of this singular contrast. There is in the ap pearance of one of our primitive forests, a gloomy wild ness, that throws a cast of solemnity over the feelings , a something in the wide spread solitude which suggests to the traveler that he is far from the habitations of man — alone, in the companionship of his own thoughts, and the presence of his God. But the prairie landscape

Early in the summer all the streams except the largest, are dried up ; the traveler is astonished as he passes over deep channels, perfectly dry, to see, by the marks of water above his head, that immense floods have recently filled them to overflowing, and at finding in the beds of rivers of sounding name, in which for months together a ship of the line might float, rivulets almost exhausted, over which he could jump at a single bound. AVet prairies occur where the surface of the plain is perfectly level, or slightly concave. A very small pro portion of the whole country is comprised within this de scription ; and all of it may be easily drained. AVe have scarcely ever seen a prairie from which the standing water might not be conveyed by a ditch a few feet in depth. They are not sufficiently extensive to produce any effect upon the atmosphere ; and as the waters are rapidly evaporated, they become dry in the early part ofthe sum mer, and are covered like the other lands with grass ; so that they do not generate miasma in any quantity which can perceptibly effect the salubrity of the air. The quality of the water in the interior, or prairie re gion, is often made a subject of complaint by travelers. The reason is obvious. The first settlers in a new coun try, and those who keep the houses of entertainment at which travelers stop, are persons who care little for the luxuries of life, and who have been accustomed to the use of spring water. They know little, and care less, about the art of procuring the pure element by means of artificial wells. AVhen obliged to resort to this method of getting water, they consider it a matter of importance to find it as near the surface as possible, or rather, if they do not find it after digging a few feet, they desist and seek it at another spot ; and choice of a place at which to reside, K

It is of good Roman time, but the head is unfortunately want ing. On the roof, Signor Vidovich has constructed a spacious reservoir ; which has already been found of great use, during the hot season, when the Avater of the river is no longer wholesome ; for in July, August, and September, the Narenta being low, the sea water extends a long distance up the stream, and mixing with it, tends to increase the fevers, which are caused by the unhealthy miasma of the marshes. The many beneficial improvements, introduced by the Pretore, are highly creditable to him. He has made roads about the toAvn, he has drained land, and planted trees ; and, by establishing nur sery grounds at Fort Opus, and Metcovich, he has reared a sufficient number of mulberry, almond, and olive trees, to supply the district. Olives and mulberries thrive rapidly there; and so well is the land suited to their growth, that I saw some only two years old, Avhich were more than double the size of any of the same age in other places. This is also the case with cabbages, and other vegetables ; which grow most luxuriantly, in this excellent soil. And such is the abundance of young plants in his nursery grounds, that Signor Vidovjch lately sent 6600 mulberry trees to the Vizir of Herzeg6Adna, for his villa at Boona ; re-

They are as infectious as the miasma. CHAPTER XXVIL Adieu to a Breakfast — Italian Village — Papal States — Monk in a Minority — Monte Cassino— Capua — Vesuvius — Skirmish with Lazzaroni. It is a very old sentiment that there is no bliss without slight twinges of pain. I arose one delicious sunny morning full of visions of scenes of southern Italy, and in fancy pictured even the Bay of Naples. Rome was particularly quiet, and seemed to have overslept itself. The payment for the formidable list of names on my passport, and the highest fare I had met in Europe for a place in a shabby diligence — the mistakes of a razor — the hasty adieu to the ruins of a breakfast — and the moving ad ventures of my baggage in pursuit of its owner were soon things of the past. I was in too happy a mood to be disturbed by trifles. The air was balmy as the breath of spring, and the Italian sky, so liquid blue and transparent, seemed like the can opy of some happier world. While our friends at home were shivering over their wintry fires, evergreens and roses in full bloom peeped here and there among the old walls beyond the Coliseum. There are two principal routes to Naples: one by Terracina, traversing for some distance the Pontine Marshes, and partially following the course of the ancient Appian Way, and the fa mous journey of Horace ; and another shorter road more inland,

The enterprise was carried on with success during 1839 ; the boundaries were finished, a farm was built, and the lagune, covering a space of about 4326 acres, and five feet three inches deep, and 213 feet three inches above the level of the sea, was drained by a canal about four and one-sixth miles long. In 1840 another farm was finished, a church built, some of the land brought into cultivation, and planta tions made ; but the decomposition of vegetable matter, and exhalations from the drying marshes, produced so much miasma and fever, that almost all the laborers who had come from the continent as servants of the company, died. As many as twenty-seven out of thirty one are said to have fallen victims ; but this fearful mortality was mainly attributed to their carelessness and imprudence : experience in this and other points prov ing that the employment of the natives, and the local resources, were the best chances of success. Sarde laborers were subsequently enlisted ; the plantations, brought from the continent, part of which had failed, and the rest been maliciously cut down, were replaced by indigenous trees ; the Sarde ox and horse were used, as better adapted than the Piedmontese race for the work and climate, though the continental ploughs, and other agricultural instruments, and a cross breed of cattle, proved to be considerable advantages. In 1841 the good effects of the drainage and cultiva tion began to be felt. The new colony, and the popu lations, hitherto annually decimated by intemperie and fever, were but slightly attacked by sickness. The Sarde laborers employed in the places of the deceased Piedmontese and French, by working with activity and

That at a later period the Aragon dominion was ac knowledged with much regard and fidelity by the Eccle siensi, is evinced by the fact, that in 1449, Alfonso IV., compelled by straitened finances, sold the feudal rights of Iglesias to Dona Leonora Manrique, Contessa di Chirra, for the sum of about 2,170/. sterling ; but the people unanimously rose and paid the sum required into the royal treasury, stipulating with the sovereign, by a document dated 1450, and now preserved in their archives, that it should be inalienable from the Aragon crown. From this circumstance the town assumed, and still bears in the quarterings of its arms, the Aragon baton as a memorial of loyal devotion, and a cylindrical piece of gold as emblematical of their self-purchased feudalism. The earliest accounts of the town date from 1257, but it does not appear ever to have been extensive or populous, owing to various invasions and pestilences, and to the slaughter by the Marquis of Oristano, about the year 1472, of all the inhabitants, except those who saved themselves in the castle, — an annihilation from which it never recovered. In 1840, the population amounted to 5,534. "> The filth ofthe town, despite some civic regulations, and the miasma from the surrounding lands, make a purgatory of this lovely spot, which might otherwise be worthy of its boasted title, a " flori de mundu." But with so much unhealthiness, there is neither poorhouse nor hospital ; and the educational wants are as little attended to, only 182 persons receiving instruction out of the whole population. The costume varies but slightly from that in other

If this was the wreck seen at such a long interval by the captain, a succession of northerly winds and gales might have driven it down so far to the southward without the assistance of any current. It is well known that the great current of the Atlantic, the gulf stream (which is occasioned by the waters, being forced by the continuous trade winds into the Gulf of Mexico, finding a vent to the northward by the coast of America, from thence towards Newfound land, and then in a more easterly direction), loses its force, and is expended to the northward of the Western Islands ; and this is the cause why so many rocks have been yearly reported to have been fallen in with in this latitude. Wrecks, all over the Atlantic, which have been water-logged but do not sink, are borne by the various winds and currents until they get into the gulf stream, which sweeps them along in its course until they arrive to where its force is ex pended, and there they remain comparatively stationary. By this time, probably, years have passed, and they are covered with sea-weeds and barnacles, and, floating three or four feet out of the water, have every appearance of rocks ; and, indeed, if run upon on a dark night, prove nearly as fatal.

Porto Praya is a miserable town, built on a most unhealthy spot, there being an extensive marsh behind it, which, from its miasma, creates a great mortality among the inhabit ants. The consul is a native of Bona Vista : two English consuls having fallen victims to the climate in quick succession, no one was found very willing to succeed to such a certain provision from the Foreign Office. The interior of the island is, however, very different from what would be expected from the sight of Porto Praya. Some of the officers paid a visit to the valley of St. Domingo, which they described as a perfect paradise, luxuriant with every tropical fruit.

The city was surrounded by marshes, and the miasma, gene- rated in these spots, caused diseases which raged with fearful effect in a city, the buildings of which were arranged in the very worst possible manner, with reference to ventilation and cleanliness. In the same year, St. Paul's Cathedral was destroyed by fire; a few years afterwards a similar calamity destroyed nearly the whole of the houses in the city. By the returns in Doom's-day Book, London appears now to have attained the position of the largest city in the kingdom. In the year 992, the predatory visits of the Danes again commenced, and were defeated in that and following years by the bravery of the citizens. The other towns and cities were, however, unable to cope with the fiery foe, and the Danes were thus in possession of all the strong-holds of the kingdom, except Can- terbury and London. Pent up in this latter city, Ethelred, in his emergency, called a national council, which met in London ; at which, it was resolved to purchase the departure of the Danish forces, at a sum, stated by historians, of <£S,000 or ,£48,000 (most probably the latter amount). The peace, thus dearly purchased, was of short duration; for Ethelred, by an act of barbarous cruelty, drew down upon himself the wrath of the Danish king, Swegen. A number of Danes being c

Snow, there may be said to be none ; and frosts are so slight, as to disperse before an hour's sun. But, above all, Australia is free from the pestilential vapours and miasma that are common in many new coun tries, and which arise from decaying vegetable deposits. The trees of Australia are evergreens ; and, although in process of time, the foliage of one year passes away, yet it may be said never to form a deposit. It remains upon the tree until the action of the sun and weather upon the leaf has had the effect of dissipating its substance, nought remaining but a dry shred, totally devoid of juices likely to resolve into gases. This provision of Nature disposes of what would otherwise prove most unhealthy, if subject to the course of European or tropical trees, in the formation of deposits of matter, which would soon putrify beneath a warm sun. Even the climate of South Africa, as far as health is con cerned, and the ability to labour in the open air, is before most parts of the Western States and Canada. But to par ticularize each, would require more space than this sketch will afford.

Scores of these revolv ing columns covered the plain, careering in every direction, and crossing one another's path, but without mingling, until they swept away out of sight on the verge of the horizon. This is the more strange, as when these whirlwinds occur, the atmosphere is generally calm and still : each of the columns seems to be acted upon by separate and distinct eddies of wind. The colony, during summer, is subject to hot winds that blow from the interior. These are supposed, by the best informed, to be caused by the westerly winds, passing over vast deserts of sand that are believed to exist there ; whilst they last, which they seldom do more than twelve hours, the atmosphere is like the breath of a furnace, the thermometer rising to 110° in the shade, and the very wood of doors and windows, shrivelling and crack ing under its effects. The climate of the colony is, on the whole, very healthy : it being so extremely dry, that no miasma or unhealthy vapours can arise through the powerful reflection of the sun's rays. The nights, even in summer, are cool ; heavy dews at night are frequent, and they much tend to promote vegetation. A strange phenomena, never witnessed in England, is often seen in New South Wales — the visual deception caused by the mirage. Barren, sandy, desert plains and valleys appear at times to be covered with water; all, as far as the eye can reach, seems but one vast lake ; yet, strong as is the illusion, in reality, not one drop of water exists around ; it is liquid air, " the mirage." )>

The anti-scientific influences of the principle have, however, not been restricted to the cloisters of the University. They have heen creeping of late over the surface of English society, as that sulphurous fog into which the arch-fiend in Milton transformed himself when he sought to dash creation into chaos, crept of old over tbe surface of Eden. The singularly extended front of opposition presented last autumn by the newspaper press of England to the British Association, when holding its sittings at Southampton, and the sort of running fire kept up for weeks after on its more distinguished members, — men such as Sir Roderick Murchison, Dr Buckland, and Mr Lyell, — seem to have been an indirect consequence of a grow ing influence in the country on the part of the revived super stition. One of the earliest assaults made on the Association, as hostile in its nature and tendencies to religion, appeared several years ago in the leading organ of Tractarianism, the " British Critic ;" but the " Critic" in those days stood much alone. Now, however, though no longer in the field, it has got not a few successors in the work, and its party many an active ally. The mediæval miasma, originated in the bogs and fens of Oxford, has been blown aslant over the face of the country ; and not only religious, but scientific truth, is to ex perience, it would seem, the influence of its poisonous blights and rotting mildews.

In crossing a river this afternoon the current was so rapid that it took my lad off his legs, and we were immersed in the stream ; we then travelled on till long after dark, seeking in vain for a suitable camping place, and at last we pitched our tent in a wet marshy hollow by a stream, on the borders of a dense forest. Some wild hogs from the forest grunted round our camp all night, and the vile musquitoes managed to get into the tent. Having been knee-deep in rain-water nearly all day, it was not surprising that, combined with sleeping on wet blankets in a swamp, and breathing miasma all night, I should wake in the morning stiff with rheumatism and nearly blind with cold in the eyes.

Throughout, the most slovenly appearance pervades the dreary7 interior. Furniture is limited to a small wicker table, a bullock's hide, and a rickety bedstead abounding in vermin ; and whilst the universal ob jection to the use of water, whether as regards the person or the apparel of the inmates, enhances the gloomy vista of cobweb desolation, dirt and filth choke up the surrounding enclosure. The absence of drains or sewers compels the population of the towns and villages to live in the miasma of decomposing matter and stagnant water. The comfort of space is never consulted — stables and outhouses are far beyond the notions of the proprietor ; and in the absence of all tidiness or comfort in the arrangement of the yards, the un seemly dunghill, which in other countries is carried away to improve the soil, is here suffered to accu mulate and rot before the entrance. Poisoning the atmosphere with its baneful exhalations, it is peri odically swept away by the descending torrents to feed the rank weeds which fatten in the mire ; but

When the great swamps of Loui siana shall have been drained and cultivated for ages, they too will doubtless be fertilized and irrigated by canals, as the great plain traversed by the Po now is. And here too, though the acres are generally well cared for, I saw tracts of considerable extent which, from original defect or un skillful management, stand below the water level of the country, and so are given over to flags, bogs and miasma, when only a foot or two of elevation is needed to render them salubrious and most productive. There are many more good dwellings on this plain than in the rural portion of Lower Italy. These are generally built of brick, covered with stucco or cement and white washed, and, being nearly square in form, two stories high, and without the long, sloping roofs common with us, are rather symmetrical and graceful, in appearance. Their roofs are tiled with a long, cylindrical brick, of which a first course is laid with the hollow upward, and another over the joints of this with the hollow down, conducting the water into the troughs made by the former and so off the house. The peasants' cottages are thatched with flags or straw, and often built of the latter material. Of barns there are relatively few, most of the wheat being stacked when harvested, and trodden out by oxen on floors under the open sky. I have not seen a good harness nor a res pectable ox-yoke in Italy, most of the oxen having yokes which a Berkshire hog of any pretensions to good breed ing would disdain to look through. These yokes merely hold the meek animals together, having no adaptation to draft, which is obtained by a cobbling filigree of ropes around the head, bringing the heaviest of the work upon

It might seem wise and well to leave the unerring laws of health and disease to work out their own results, in punishing those aa*Iio neglect the neces sary conditions by Avhich alone health can be maintained where men congregate together ; but as the epidemics engendered by such neglect cannot be confined to those who are their responsible producers, the legislature, on behalf of society at large, has the right to interfere. The application of the act to Worcester has been productive of immediate results that are sufficiently curious ; but its importance, as regards the future welfare of the city, cannot be overrated, and on that account, much more than for any present turmoil, which, in " the whirligig of time," will subside and be for gotten, the subject claims a special notice here. Worcester, more than most English towns, needed the application of such a measure to its internal economy. Its fair exterior, and the outward cleanliness of its principal streets, are but the deceitful masks of hidden insalubrities. Surrounded by hills, which attract the moisture and screen it from the healthful breezes that would drive away miasma, its atmosphere is too constantly damp and relaxing in summer, and in winter the fogs, rising from the stream and the undrained soil, lie long upon its dwellings. The river, which flows through it, fortunately keeps up a constant current of air, but epidemics always follow the course of rivers. Though apparently well situated for drainage, the greater part of the city is ill-circumstanced in this respect, for the southern and western half, at least, is built on a cold marl, which retains the soakings of the surface as a sponge. These are natural reasons which, it might be supposed, would have suggested to

We occasionally passed a picturesque Gipsy camp in the wood ; a large khan with its verandah full of travellers smoking their pipes, while their horses fed at a short distance ; or a village formed of log-huts scattered about amongst the trees. There was a little cultivation here and there, where the country was more open, and I remarked that every field was enclosed with hurdles, which one might have supposed to be a symptom of an improved state of husbandry. ; but it was in fact only a necessary precaution against the numerous herds of swine that roam about, half-wild, in search of acorns, their staple food in Serbia. In front of one of the khans where we stopped to let the horses breathe, I saw a very smart pony, which was being taken to Belgrade for sale. Nothing could surpass the beauty of his form, but his head was somewhat heavy ; as a park -hack he would have fetched 30/. in London, and he was offered to me for 41., one half of which sum was probably added in the hope of gulling a stranger. We forded a stream, almost stagnant, and the fever miasma visibly brooding over it like a thin vapour. The whole of this district is said to be exceedingly unhealthy. We passed through the hamlet of Stublina, and crossed the small, but rapid river Tamlana on a curious wooden bridge. In the afternoon we reached the large village of Banian, nestling in a hollow amono-st

At the first turning of the river, a circular wall presents itself upon the right, which encloses an image of the Virgin, the principal deity of the Catholics, and more especially the patroness of those whose bread is cast upon the waters. Sometimes an old man may be seen to cross his breast in token of reverence as he passes ; but it is a rare thing with one of this, unbelieving sex. The women, however, almost always make the holy sign ; their lips move ; occasionally they sink upon their knees, and bend their head. In the curve of a creek close by is the Houssiniere, an antique-looking building, set down in a very romantic situation, and appropriated to the dignified leisure of the prefects of the department. On the other side of the river is a rock without any thing remarkable in its appearance, although the view from the top is fine. It is called, or rather miscalled, the Rocher d'Enfer. Towards the north of the Houssiniere the little river Cens falls into the Erdre, and forms a bay, the surface of which is covered with aquatic plants, which in summer, having scarcely water enough to sustain them, exhale their complaints in the form of miasma. Beyond the bay, on the left bank of the river, are the ruins of a chateau, surrounded b} lofty trees. Let us now borrow for an instant the pen of a native of Nantes, whose book is frequently an agreeable companion.1 " The imagination," says he, " having nothing to excite it, we sink into a reverie made up more of sensations than ideas.

In 1537, Marguerite de Valois, the celebrated Queen of Navarre, spent some months in this retreat ; and as she was accustomed to amuse herself with writing in her journeys, the banks of the Erdre, in all probability, in spired some of her tales. After passing several country houses, we get a glimpse of the bourg of Suce, a place as ancient as the days of Barbe-Torte, the conqueror of the Normans. ' It is situated, in the manner of a sea-port, at the bottom of a creek, the sides of which are lofty, and covered with a thick foliage. On the opposite, or left bank of the Erdre, are the remains of an ancient seignorial chateau, which served as a country residence of the bishops. The principal gate is still pre served entire; and, standing on the summit of a conical rock, it presents a very picturesque appearance. At Mazerolles the scene changes. The river widens, and the low banks, covered with mist, are faintly seen in the distance. In the twilight, when the shore is only half visible, or altogether escapes the eye, one might imagine himself upon the ocean. The plain of waters appears illimitable; the silence is intense ; and the river so black, so heavy, so stirless, that you may fancy it the Dead Sea. In the midst of this noiseless solitude, there are two islands — the only islands in the whole course of the river. One of these is thickly wooded, and covered with the vine of Saint Denis. There was found in it, below the surface of the ground, a canoe formed of the trunk of a single tree, in the manner of savages. The second island boasts of one tree — but this is an old oak, whose branches sustain an image of the Holy Virgin. Many pilgrimages are made to the spot by persons suffering from fevers produced by the miasma of

M. de Nagu, the lord of the village of Marais Vernier, once gained a bet which he had made to send six cabbages to Paris weighing three hundred pounds. One of this illustrious half-dozen alone weighed sixty-eight ! The strange thing is, that these enormous vegetables preserve no analogy with the animal kingdom under such circum stances, but keep their proper flavour amidst all their excess of growth. The potato, however, is an exception to this rule. It grows, like the rest, to a colossal size ; but, in a soil so different from that of its natural hard and stony bed, it contracts a taste of soap. The agricultural implements used in the marsh are very unlike, as we may suppose, those of other districts. The spade, for instance, which is employed in turning over earth that presents no resistance, is almost as large in pro portion as the fruits of the soil. The beds are generally intersected at every fifteen feet of width by ditches, or drains, of six feet. But while the principle of vegetable life developes itself so vigorously, that of human life declines. The miasma of the marsh is fatal ; and in autumn more espe cially, or in the intense heats of summer, the victims are numerous. The disease produced is a slow fever, which varies in malignity with the state of the atmosphere, but for which there is no hope in medicine. Doctors, notwith standing, are called as usual; drugs are swallowed; and the patient descends into the tomb secundum artem. The fresh tints of the women of Quillebœuf are here unknown. Sallow complexions, spiritless eyes, and feeble limbs, demonstrate the deadly influence of the marsh. Almost every girl you meet is an orphan — every woman a widow.

The sea breeze is very healthy and refreshing, but the land breeze, although much cooler, is often very dangerous, particularly in Jamaica, where it is almost certain fever to sleep with your windows open towards the land, and the land breeze, which has probably crossed miles of swamps and got saturated with miasma, playing upon you. In Barbadoes and most of the small islands to windward, the sea breeze blows by night as well as by day; this is also the case in the larger islands during the heat of summer, the land at that time being heated to such a degree that the air of the mountains is not sufficiently dense to check the cur rent which flows from the sea : this accounts for the greater healthiness of some of the low islands. The north-east trade, a gentle three and four knot breeze, flows almost without cessation throughout the year. This is caused by much the same causes which regu late the land and sea breezes. The portion of the globe between the tropics being much hotter than any other part, and the air be coming rarefied, it ascends, and the winds from the poles flow gradually in to supply its place. The air near the equator, when rarefied, blows back over the lower strata of colder air towards the poles, there to be again condensed, and form another trade wind. Thus there are two currents of air continually in motion in each hemisphere, an upper aud a lower

"Perhaps ye know what ye'r laughing at, my dark boy; an' it's meself that'll be afther givin' ye a taste of the way we Yankees do the thing, savin' the presence of his honor here," said the mate, dashing his hat on the ground, and advancing a step toward my new acquaintance, who recoiled in evident alarm.

While this scene was transpiring, a ghostly-looking indi vidual, wan with numberless fevers, approached us. He was dressed in white, wore a jacket and a glazed cap, and upon the latter, in gilded capitals, we read " Police." He took off his cap, bowed low, for he was used to it, and said that Her Britannic Majesty's Consul General presented his respects to the gentlemen, regretted that, being confined to his house by bodily infirmity, he could not wait on them in person, and hoped that under the circumstances the gentle men would do him the favor to call upon him.

001266859	001266859_197	188 CAUSES OF CRETINISM. where yet no cretinism is found. It is very common in England. The well-known locaUties of cretinism as well as of goitre, in Swit zerland, are the deeper valleys and their outlets, and it has been very generally admitted, of late, on the strength of little more than this fact of locality, that the main cause there operative in producing them, is what is vaguely termed confined air, assisted by the dirty habits of the people, &c. The old theories deriving these diseases from snow-water, water having mineral impregnation, &c.,have been generally abandoned as untenable. The snow-water theory is, of aU others, most improbable, seeing that snow or glacier-water is most rarely used, while that which is in habitual use is among the finest and purest in the world, and exists in boundless quantity. Notwithstanding what has just been stated, of the want of evi dence as to the essential connexion of goitre and cretinism, I am myself inclined to beUeve that they may very possibly have an essen tial connexion, inasmuch as they may be both owing to the same cause, or to a modification of the same cause. I make no attempt to investigate the precise nature of such cause, nor do I propound even a conjecture respecting it, as the result of any special or enlarged consideration of the subject ; but my present impression is, that it is some form of that unknown local influence or thing, commonly recog nised under the name of miasma or malaria, and which operates on the animal system as a poison, producing special modifications of function and special changes of structure, according to certain special conditions, which, however, are like itself unknown. As the un known thing which we term malaria or miasm of marshes, under certain circumstances gives rise at one time to simple ague, at another to a fatal remittent fever, &c, and produces at times a morbid enlargement of the spleen, at others disease of the liver, &c. &c. ; so I can imagine that some other malaria or unknown thing or influence, of local origin, may be the cause of ordinary bronchocele, of the aggravated bronchocele or goitre of the Alps, and also of cretinism. There must be something more than stagnant or impure or heated air requisite for its production, as we find it frequently more rife in the larger than in the smaller valleys, as in the instances of the great

THE STATE OF OAJACA. This rich and beautiful State lies, for 118 leagues, along the Pacific Ocean. On the north-west, it is bounded by the State of Puebla, on the north by Vera Cruz, and east by the State of Chiapas and the republic of Central America or Guatemala. It extends from east to west about 115 leagues, and from north to south 322 leagues, containing an area of 5,046 square leagues. We pass now from the hot and sickly sands and marshes of the eastern coast to a region which has been considered by many writers and travellers as the most delightful in Mexico. Beauty of natural scenery and salubrity of climate, fertility of soil and richness of productions, combine to render Oajaca valuable, not only in a commercial aspect, but as a residence in which it would be agree able to pass a life time. Nor is this the opinion only of the present inhabitants, for the remains of antiquity still found within the limits of the State, prove it to have been the seat of Indian civilization long before the arrival of the Spaniards. The geological structure of this State is different from that of Puebla and Mexico ; and the vegetation is quite as vigorous as that of other prolific regions, without the rankness which produces rapid decomposition and miasma. The rains are generally abundant from May to October. In our general description of the geological and geographical characteristics of Mexico, we have already shown that the greal

This was denied him on the ground of his possessing arti cles of personal property of more value than to entitle him to relief from the government. The few articles of last necessity actu ally in his possession, being of a nature not transferable for cash, he applied for permission to bury the decomposing bodies in the narrow garden adjoining his shop. But this, of course, was denied him. The offensive corpses remained in this condition in his room, until some gentleman accidentally passing, was so struck by the disagreeable stench, as to be led to enter, to learn whence it pro ceeded. His astonishment may be imagined, on finding two bodies in the most loathsome condition, and the little room filled with virulent miasma. To his demand why they had not been inter red, the half-deranged father replied, " My good sir, I would have rejoiced to bury them in a hole like dogs, had I been permitted to do so." It is needless to add, that the case was then promptly cared for. I learned this from persons who were eye-witnesses of the scene. It was also published in one of the London jour nals, the Times, I think. This is doubtless an extreme case ; but it will not be denied, there are enough others coming to light every day, which, if not so strange as this, are yet dreadful to think of. Indeed, I was assured by English gentlemen themselves, of high respectability, that no human tongue could adequately describe the heart-appalling miseries of the poor of London. Much of this misery may doubtless be attributed more to de moralization than mere misfortune. Still, there must ever be much of the latter. Where condition of life is so strictly ruled, and struggle for pecuniary means so intense as in London, there is left the merest chance to regain a lost foothold upon the ladder of panting existence. Where society is so pressed into time-worn ruts, the vicissitudes of life fall with fatal effect. Nor is there any relief from dire extremity by flying into the country. There, 31

St. John the Baptist's living on locusts and wild honey is easily understood by any one who has been in these countries. The Abyssinians refuse to eat the locust, and deny that it was the insect which was the Saint's food, asserting that it was the fruit of a tree called by the same name (ambatta). The niggers and inhabitants of Sennaar, however, eat the locusts willingly. I have often tasted them ; and though there is nothing disagreeable in their flavour, still I can not say that they are a particularly delicious food. The natives prepare them by pulling off their legs and wings, and roasting them on an iron dish, like coffee. The usual spot chosen by a scout for passing the night is on some small hill, which, being a little elevated above the water, places the sleeper, in a measure, out of danger of miasma and of being run over by a herd of buffaloes or elephants. There is a very convenient spot for this purpose not far below Rohabaita : a hollow in the top of the hillock prevents the fire from being seen either by man or beast, and the canes below are often chosen by buffaloes as lodging for the night. Far from keeping up great fires, as a protection from wild beasts, hunters on the Mareb usually make theirs either in a natural hole in the ground, or dig one on purpose, if such should not be found in a convenient spot, and pile boughs of trees all round to prevent the glare from being seen.

The valley lies between the town of Nahun and the river Jumna. The jungle is so dense, that in the rainy season, in order to escape the pestilential exhalations and miasma, the inhabitants of the valley used to make annual migrations ; and the marshy soil was so luxuriant that, during their absence, long rank grass and thick underwood had sprung up, and obliterated all traces of their labours. This valley was formerly in posses sion of the Ghoorkhas, who were expelled by the British forces. In former times this Dhoon was well-peopled and well-culti vated, according to ancient accounts ; and its subsequent insa lubrity may be attributed to the rapid over-growth of jungle from neglect.

The conse quence is, a group of maladies under which the strong est constitution at length breaks down. But I am convinced from personal experience, that with proper precaution and suitable food, many, and most of these evils may be obviated. The southern mines are in elevations which exempt them from the maladies in cident to the low lands which fringe the streams farther north. There are no stagnant waters, no de composition of vegetable matter, no miasma drifting about in the fog, to shake and burn you with alternate chill and fever. I never enjoyed better health and spirits ; and never encountered in a great moving mass, notwithstanding their irregularities, so few in stances of disease traceable to local causes.

Lapses from virtue are not un frequently associated, in the character of the Spanish female, with singular exhibitions of charity and self denial. She is often at the couch of disease, un shrinkingly exposed to contagion, or in the hovel of destitution, administering to human necessity. She pities where others reproach, and succors where others forsake. The motive which prompts this un wearied charity, is a secret within her own soul. It

Indeed they have felt that no prayer or song could be made out of the subject, except in distinct and decided opposition to carrying our arms beyond the boundaries of our enormous territory into those of a weak and distracted neighbor. The eccle siastical bodies of this country, with scarcely an exception in the free States, have come out in votes and resolutions of the most stringent condemnation of the war.* These facts may show how utterly they have deemed it to be opposed to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and may by some be regarded as an intimation, though by no means a proof, that such was the reality. But, in marked contrast with the above, we record as exempUfications of the fatal, corrupting influence of the war miasma, the cases of some even of the ministers of Christ, who entered the army, and who preached and prayed in favor of the war. A private letter from a Lieutenant in the service, says ; " We have here among the volunteers a preacher who is a captain, his officers and non-commissioned officers are deacons of his church ; and the privates mem bers. He is caUed the fighting Preacher. He and his com pany are from ." We have already mentioned that a preacher was killed in the ranks in the battle of Buena Vista. Sermons, which are now before us, were preached both on the Rio Grande, and at the city of Mexico before the troops, justifying the war, talking largely of the " Anglo Saxon destiny," comparing the progress of the American arms with the entrance of the children of Israel into the land of Canaan, and giving the sanctions and benedictions of Chris tianity to the awful wrongs and barbarities of one of the most cruel, sanguinary, and demoralizing wars on record. ♦ Advocate of Peace, Nov. and Dec. 1847, pp. 134 — 137.

The Times newspaper, during the late epidemic, noticed a petition emanating from the Archbishop of Canterbury, and other house holders in Lambeth, praying that bone crushers be henceforth forbidden to ply then* trade in that neigh bourhood. The memorial stated that the epidemic then raging in Lambeth with unprecedented severity, was aggravated by the miasma generated from the decom posed bones. If the late pestilence did no more than lay bare the nuisances of the MetropoUs, and spur our lagging energy to agitate for their removal, it had its end. Just as a wasting malady discloses to the patient's observation symptoms of other deep-seated diseases, which otherwise might have lurked in his system unobserved, — so the Cholera settled down upon some plague spot, where everything was at hand to feed it and extend its ravages, and thus laid bare the inward sores of London. Within a given circle hundreds sickened, — science quailed before it ; it struck down right and left the doomed victims, — baffling the usual arts of the physician, it drove him to a new analysis ; he became a disciple of the sanatory science, — at length discovered, in some reeking sewer, or licensed pest-yard, the source of the disease, — en- deavoured to cope with a new adversary, now happily dragged from his hiding-place.

In winter the spots infected by the malaria are perfectly healthy. Their insalubrity commences with the summer heats, and disappears when the air has been cooled by the autumnal rains. But even du ring the prevalence of the miasma, its partial operation is one of the oddest circumstances. Rome stands in the midst of an infected district ; but some parts of the city are always safe, others become unhealthy every summer, and a few, like the Aventine, are absolutely pestilential. Even one side of a street is occasionally insalubrious, while the other is free ; and the upper and lower stories of the same house are affected not less unequally. The constitutional effects on those who are constantly exposed to thfl miasmata are painfully visible in their livid skin and bloated bodies." — I extract this note from the third volume of Mr. Spalding's work, which contains, un questionably, the most systematic and correct account we have of Italy, where every scene and incident offer so much temptation to exaggerate.

Before dinner we strolled around the ramparts, which are pleasant of themselves though the place stands in a marsh, which renders its position not only strong, but strongly disagreeable. We endeavoured in vain to find some features to revive the pictures of " Quentin Durward." There was no sign of a soldier in the place, though barracks were building. The French are evidently less jealous of this frontier, than of that on the east, or the one next the Austrians. The next morning we breakfasted at Cambray. Here we found a garrison, and considerable activity. The citadel is well placed, and the esplanade is a pretty walk. We visited the cathedral, which contains a monument to Fenelon, by our friend David. We were much gratified by this work, which ranks among his best. Near Valenciennes we broke a tire, and were detained two hours. Here the garrison was still stronger, the place in better condition, and the troops mounted guard with their marching accoutrements about them; all of which, I presume, was owing to the fact, that this is the last fortified town on the road. We did not get to the frontier until seven, and the French postilions broke another bolt before we got fairly rid of them, compelling us to wait an hour to have it mended. We were now in a low wet country, or one perfectly congenial to cholera; it was just the hour when the little demons of miasma are said to be the most active, and to complete the matter, we learned that the disease was in the village. The carriage-windows were closed, while I walked about, from door to door, to pacify un- easiness by curiosity. Use, however, had made us all tole- rably indifferent, and little P settled the matter by re marking it was nothing after all, for here only two or three died daily, while at Paris there had been a thousand! Older heads than his, often take material facts more in a lump than this. The change in the national character is so evident, imme diately on crossing into Belgium, as to occasion surprise. The
000048382	000048382_84	70 INUNDATIONS. Before the inundation of last year a small trench was cut across the isthmus at the Red River, where the Mississippi takes a sweep of eio-hteen miles. When the river rose, a small 0 rill first passed through the cut ; gradually the water increased ; it became a torrent ; and finally the mighty river itself rolled through the trees, tore up a new channel for itself, and now fills the few hundred yards of isthmus with its turbid waters, leaving the eighteen miles nearly dry. Besides the alteration in the course of the Missis sippi at this interesting spot, no material change has taken place for some time. It is a well-ascertained fact, that near the Mis sissippi the elevated ground is more unhealthy than the river's bank itself. The miasma seems to collect about elevated spots, and they are there fore avoided by old residents. Another pecu liarity of the river is, that the banks are generally higher than the country for some distance behind them, so that at the commencement of the annual inundation the river flows in three channels. After a time it rolls in one undivided and vast torrent, sweeping through the trees, and carrying many with it, with masses of the bank. After leaving Memphis, the steam-vessel was progressing against the stream at the rate of seven knots an hour. She was in the middle of the river, there about sixty feet deep, and as smooth and unruffled as a polished mirror, when at four in the afternoon she struck heavily against a con-

The approach to it is through alternate prairies and richly wooded bot toms, that fringe the lake with a vegetation of stu pendous growth, and give glimpses of its sparkling waters and blue islets through festoons of vines overhanging the road for miles continuously. It must in summer be a scene of fairy land. Peoria is about the geographical centre of Illi nois, though by no means as }*et the centre of popu lation, which is still far to the south-east. This place is rapidly improving, and may very possibly become the future seat of government. It has in exhaustible quantities of bituminous coal in its vi cinity, and commands an unbroken steamboat navi gation with St. Louis. The adjacent country is very fertile. The soil, like that, of Illinois gene rally, is better suited to the grazier than the agri culturist. It is composed of a black and rich mould, with a small admixture of fine silicious sand, and rests on soft and permeable clay without being interspersed with stone or gravel. This formation, while it is unfavourable to the existence of perennial streams and fountains, and impedes the plough of the agriculturist, and endangers his health by the creation of miasma, yet in the vicinity of the middle lands furnishes inexhaustible meadows to the gra- zier, and every facility for canals and railroads. The Illinois River was described by General G. B. Clark so long ago as 1777, as "a natural canal passing through natural meadows ;" and the facility with which branches might be made as the country requires them is now very apparent. The route of

Had this course been pursued at Pangoringan, much of the sickness would have been prevented. The sickness commenced there, in consequence ofthe exposure of the men to the miasmas from low and swampy ground, while procuring wood and water for the ship. While at Batavia, and on our passage through the China seas, nearly the whole starboard side of the gun-deck was literally a hospital. The chief disease with which they were seized was the dysentery. The climate in tropical regions is very trying to the constitutions of both officers and men, and those most firm and vigorous wither under its baneful in fluence. The atmosphere is at times very oppressive, the winds light and variable, and showers, accompanied by thunder and lightning, are frequent. Sailors are very imprudent, and lie about the wet decks with but little co vering, exposed to the rays of a tropical sun ; consequent ly, their biliary and digestive organs become deranged, when they easily fall victims to those diseases " flesh is heir to " in these climes, which so often terminate fatally. Death was busy carrying our fellow beings out of our sight. During our passage to Canton, I had some con versation with one young man, who seemed fully sensible of his dangerous situation, and was considerably agitated in view of death. I told him it was not too late for him to fly to the Saviour for refuge, and to take hold of the hope laid before him in the gospel. He listened with some interest, thanked me for my advice, and wished to be prayed for. He said his parents were pious, and that he

The report of the native inhabitants is in favour of the salubrity of these provinces, especially of Martaban and Mer gui. Our own short experience seems to confirm this opinion. I have not, indeed, heard of any spot or place in our southern provinces remarkable for the existence of concentrated miasma — the source of those malignant remittent fevers and dysenteries, which are endemic in many parts of India. The only malignant complaint Avhich has prevailed amongst our troops, has been ulcer of the loAver limbs, confined to natives of India, and, in all likelihood, chiefly to be ascribed to tempo rary hardships and privations. The only useful minerals, of which the exist ence is ascertained in the territories now under description are, lime, iron, antimony, and tin. Blue mountain lime-stone, affording the whitest quick-lime I ever saw, is widely and generally dis tributed over the plains of Martaban, forming those detached rocks to which I have already alluded. An ore of magnetic iron has been found in Tavoy ; stream tin is found in Tavoy and Mer gui ; and a rich ore of antimony in quartz rock in Martaban. The most valuable of the rude productions of the new territory is teak-timber. The teak is
003893652	003893652_379	364 THE WEST INDIA In the mean time, sickness caused by miasma, issuing from the extensive tracts of uncleared land, has continued to add its numbers to the bills of mor- tality. Property is chiefly in the hands of French settlers, who compose the principal portion of the society. As a military position, Saint Lucia is considered an acquisition to Great Britain, but, notwithstanding its great natural resources, as a British colony, it ranks in the lowest scale among these islands. Government House, which stands on a hill over looking the town, is decidedly one of the best houses we found in the Caribbees. No wonder that three or four general officers, within the last few years, should have selected it to die in ; and the ascent of the hill to gain possession of it, affords an admirable commentary upon a traverse course through life to the English again attempting a settlement, the right of possession was disputed by the French and English crowns ; and in 1 748 it was declared, with Tobago, Saint Vincent, and Dominica, a neutral island, and to belong to the Caribs. In 1762 it was taken by the English, ceded to France in the following year, retaken by the English in 1 778, again ceded to France in 1783, surrendered to the English in 1794, again ceded to France in 1802, retaken in 1803, and finally ceded to Great Britain in 1814.

There is also a class of mathematics, where the com- mandant of engineers attends, and gives instruction to a certain number of youths. Two schools for boys, and one for girls, are paid for by the municipality. The arsenal is a large space of land enclosed with a stone wall, outside the walls near the wharf, with stores, offices, workshops for constructing vessels, quarters for the workmen and the troops, and a guard-house. A wharf has been constructed, and a machine for embark ing and debarking cannon. A few years ago, the land on which this arsenal now stands was a mangrove swamp, which was highly injurious to the health of the city; for the land breeze, which sets in every evening and lasts till morning, blowing from the south, could not fail to waft to the town its deadly miasma, so prejudicial to human life in tropical climates. Were it not that it would weaken the defence of the place, by allowing an attack ing enemy ground on which to construct batteries for assailing the fortress on the land side, great benefit would no doubt arise from cutting down the mangrove trees to the east of the town, and draining the swamp on which they grow. The custom-house was built in 1826. It is most con veniently situated outside the walls, near the wharf. It is not large enough for a deposit of goods, but a new one for this purpose is about to be erected near it, which, I trust, will fully meet the object intended. The cathedral is a large mass of building, which has never been finished. There are four churches and two chapels in the city. The episcopal palace is a commo-

From ex periments relative to the influence of marshes on human hfe, the following conclusions have been drawn, namely, that in the salubrious portions of our climate, the winter and spring months are those which give the greatest number of deaths, and the winter is more fatal in the north than the south. In marshy places the greatest number of deaths is in July, August, September, and October ; and this, by the way, I found to be the case in Rome. The evaporation of such grounds appears to be more fatal to children from one to six years of age ; and the complaint that generally attacks them, owing to mal-aria, is understood to be an acute gastro-intestinal affection. As a protection against this, it is recommended to wear a silk covering over the head and face. If, as is to be presumed, the noxious matter is con veyed through the lungs, it may not be difficult to account for the efficiency of this simple preventive. The nature of these poisons is such that they are easily decomposed, and that by the feeblest chemical agents. It is possible that the heated and compound gas, which proceeds from the lungs, and forms an atmosphere within the veil of silk, may have power to decompose the miasma in its passage to the mouth, or it may be true that the mechanical texture of the silk prevents the transmission of any deleterious sub stance, or that such covering possesses the property of acting as a non-conductor of miasmata as well as of electricity. The streets of Corfu are narrow and paltry, and the houses are constructed in the Venetian fashion, the lower story supporting the upper by arches, which afford shelter from both rain and sun. There are several churches, and great festivals, especially that of St. Spiridion, the tutelar saint, which it would be tedious to describe. A magazine was destroyed by fire here in 1789, when 72,000lbs. of

At the first turning of the river, a circular wall presents itself upon the right, which encloses an image of the Virgin, the principal deity of the Catholics, and more especially the patroness of those whose bread is cast upon the waters. Sometimes an old man may be seen to cross his breast in token of reverence as he passes ; but it is a rare thing with one of this unbelieving sex. The women, however, almost always make the holy sign ; their lips move ; occasionally they sink upon their knees, and bend their head. In the curve of a creek close by is the Houssiniere, an antique-looking building, set down in a very romantic situation, and appropriated to the dignified leisure of the prefects of the department. On the other side of the river is a rock without any thing remarkable in its appearance, although the view from the top is fine. It is called, or rather miscalled, the Rocher d'Enfer. Towards the north of the Houssiniere the little river Cens falls into the Erdre, and forms a bay, the surface of which is covered with aquatic plants, which in summer, having scarcely wrater enough to sustain them, exhale their complaints in the form of miasma. Beyond the bay, on the left bank of the river, are the ruins of a chateau, surrounded by lofty trees. Let us now borrow for an instant the pen of a native of Nantes, whose book is frequently an agreeable companion.1 " The imagination," says he, " having nothing to excite it, we sink into a reverie made up more of sensations than ideas. Our impressions are all of a calm and even 1 Voyage dans le departement dc la Loire Inferieure, par M. E. Richer.

In 1537, Marguerite de Valois, the celebrated Queen of Navarre, spent some months in this retreat ; and as she was accustomed to amuse herself with writing in her journeys, the banks of the Erdre, in all probability, in spired some of her tales. After passing several country houses, we get a glimpse of the bourg of Suce, a place as ancient as the days of Barbe-Torte, the conqueror of the Normans. It is situated in the manner of a sea-port, at the bottom of a creek, the sides of which are lofty, and covered with a thick foliage. On the opposite, or left bank of the Erdre, are the remains of an ancient seignorial chateau, which served as a country residence of the bishops. The principal gate is still pre served entire ; and, standing on the summit of a conical rock, it presents a very picturesque appearance. At Mazerolles the scene changes. The river widens, and the low banks, covered with mist, are faintly seen in the distance. In the twilight, when the shore is only half visible or altogether escapes the eye, one might imagine himself upon the ocean. The plain of waters appears illimitable ; the silence is intense ; and the river so black, so heavy, so stirless, that you may fancy it the Dead Sea. In the midst of this noiseless solitude, there are two islands — the only islands in the w'hole course of the river. One of these is thickly wooded, and covered with the vine of Saint Denis. There was found in it, below the surface of the ground, a canoe formed of the trunk of a single tree, in the manner of savages. The second island boasts of one tree — but this is an old oak, whose branches sustain an image of the Holy Virgin. Many pilgrimages are made to the spot by persons suffering from fevers produced by the miasma of

The strange thing is, that these enormous vegetables preserve no analogy with the animal kingdom under such circum stances, but keep then proper flavour amidst all then excess of growth. The potato, however, is an exception to this rale. It grows, like the rest, to a colossal size ; but, in a soil so different from that of its natural hard and stony bed, it contracts a taste of soap. The agricultural implements used in the marsh are very unlike, as we may suppose, those of other districts. The spade, for instance, which is employed in turning over earth that presents no resistance, is almost as large in pro portion as the fruits of the sod. The beds are generally intersected at every fifteen feet of width by ditches, or drains, of six feet. But while the principle of vegetable life developes itself so vigorously, that of human life declines. The miasma of the marsh is fatal ; and in autumn more espe cially, or in the intense heats of summer, the victims are numerous. The disease produced is a slow fever, which varies in malignity with the state of the atmosphere, but for which there is no hope in medicine. Doctors, notwith standing, are called as usual ; drugs are swallowed ; and the patient descends into the tomb secundum artem. The fresh tints of the women of Quillebœuf are here unknown. Sallow complexions, spiritless eyes, and feeble limbs, demonstrate the deadly influence of the marsh. Almost every girl you meet is an orphan — every woman a widow.

The residences of the merchants are most tastefully built — space everywhere the great feature, and situated about 100 feet from the road — the garden completely filled with the richest garb of nature. The houses are all white, of two stories, and cover, with the outbuildings, from one-eighth to an acre of ground. Land in plenty, and the residents have made the most of it. The canals, as in the old town branch off from the little river in all direc tions, and are the receptacle of all the filth and sewerage of the town. The natives can be seen at all times boating up and down ; the washerwomen and men dashing the clothes down on a wooden form as if made of sheepskin ; your wardrobe soon requires replenishing, for few articles of wearing apparel are equal to such hard usage. The native girls were fjlunging in and out of the water in a costume remarkable for its simplicity — perfectly innocent of the presence of the European stranger, who gazes with such familiarity and curious interest upon the peculiar habits of the people, whose simple customs he notices for the first time. The new town is situated on the heights of Weltevreden, the site selected by Governor Daendels when he was prevented from removing the seat of government to Sourabaya, on account of the fatal miasmas of the place. So generally was the rush to get out of the old port by everybody but the Celestials, the place would have been a ruin, had not a new administration come into power, with Baron Capellen at its head, who, with a sprinkling of Yankee enterprise metamorphosed the entire city ; and the filling up and repairing of the canals — the widening of the streets — the tearing down of old buildings to make room for new, and removal of accumulated filth, will be the meaus of keeping his name gratefully alive in the memory of those who

When Cæsar's legions chased the painted savages along the shores of Kent, many a deadly Pontine marsh held the place of what is now a salubri ous champaign country of orchards corn and cattle ; and the primeval climate of Albion probably mowed down more of the invaders than did the scythed chariots of her woad-stained warriors. A few years since the ague was the scourge of my native swamps ■ in Lincolnshire ; and fen infants, like my self, were only preserved by copious cups of bark and wine. But now, reed and rush and snake and buzzard rat and eel have vanished before the plough ; the " reek o' the rotten fen " is gone ; and the ague a tradition of the past. It is difficult to credit that the climate of Canada could ever have been more inclement than it is now ; yet old greybeards of the bush tell us that sixty years ago Canadian winters were winters worthy of the Arctic zone. Settle ment and cultivation will produce like effects in New Zealand ; so that we may plume ourselves on the thought that if the climate be good now, it will be better ere long, and perfect for our poste rity.

The health of the town itself is said, by those who have lived there, to be good; and, judging from appearances, one would think that the strong sea breeze, that blows every day fresh from the gulf, would prevent the accumulation of any miasma ; but there are no local causes for that, for on one side is the gulf, and on the other the vast prairie. Decaying timber is out of the question, for wood, even for fuel, cannot be procured ; and every stick of building timber must be brought from New Orleans, Mobile, or other ports. The Dutch emigrants, who had been arriving here in im mense numbers, and departing to their colony on the head waters of the Guadaloupe, had, many of them, died ; but that was owing to their sudden change of habits — from those of a long sea voyage, — living upon salt provisions — to the expo sure to the hot sun of the prairies, and a change to fresh beef, of which, we were told, they ate on their first arrival, with great gluttony. — This will account for the extensive sickness among them. When we were at Port Lavacca, it was a busy place, for beside the arrival and departure of emigrants, the 1st and 2d regiments of Illinois infantry, under colonels Hardin and Bissel, had landed there, together with a battalion of regular infantry, another of dragoons, and a battery of artillery. — These had all marched from this place to San Antonio, where, joined by the Arkansas cavalry, Col. Yell, the whole, num bering about 3,000 men, made up the army of Gen. Wool. All the stores of provision, ammunition, and other things necessary for the support of such an army, in the long march over a perfect wilderness of hundreds of miles, which they were to perform, had to be landed and stored here, and trans ported by land from this to San Antonio; and hundreds of teams were, for between two and three months, all busy in making trips back and forth between the two places. Beside this, the Kentucky cavalry and our own regiment, had been ordered here, and large amounts of stores had been sent

The caravans which for about six months in the year pass and repass this solitary route, invariably travel in large parties to ensure mutual protection against an attack of predatory Tougrourees, and the no less dangerous assaults of wild beasts. As our own party was not very strong we marched almost without intermission, by day and night, an effort which, in our exhausted condition, made our limbs ache, and our heads throb" with most agonizing pain. On the second morning we descended through a long range of hills down into a steep, green wilder ness ; and from thence, between groves of bamboo, ebony, and different species of euphorbia, we rode on to Wochnee, which we reached ere the sun had mounted above the horizon. I had heard so much of Wochnee, that I expected to see a large village, occupied by an industrious, busy population ; but, to my surprise, I found that the grand market of Western Abyssinia's trade is periodically held in the depth of a dense forest, where, even during the driest season, the luxuriant vegetation hemmed in by steep, towering mountain-ranges, exhales from its humid soil a pestilential miasma. A few miserable huts for the accommodation of the grim collectors of the duty, and the distillers of detch and dallah, were the only habitations visible in this wooded soli tude.

To that portion of Algeria in which the soil is subject to the conditions just described, the French give the name of Landes. These landes, or elevated steppes, constitute a kind of middle link between the Tel, or hill country, and the Sahara, the former of which may be regarded as universally susceptible of culti vation under favourable circumstances, and the latter as altogether hopeless. Two points have been mentioned as marking the only outlets existing for the waters of the central portion of Algeria. The extent of surface drained * The state of things here supposed may be illustrated by the condition of the plain of Thessaly before the gorge of Tempe was formed ; by that of the plain of Bohemia antecedently to its drainage by the present channel of the Elbe in Saxon Switzerland ; by the basin of the Rhine between Basle and Bingen previous to the con vulsion which tapped the vast accumulation of waters by forming the channel which now extends from St. Goar to the Drachenfels ; and' by several portions of the valley of the Rhone.

Now all was life and animation ; the population of the town was more than doubled by some thousands of Yankees, awaiting conveyance to California ; having bought through tickets for California in the United States, in good faith, and supposing that they would be at once forwarded on their arrival here, they now, to their dismay, found that they had been mis led, and that they would be obliged to wait months before they could get a passage. The situation of these people was deplora ble, many without means, in a deadly climate, and unable to speak the language, with families of women and little children dependent upon them ; exposure and unhealthy diet soon pro duced their natural consequences, and the fatality among them was awful — the cholera and native fevers vying with each other in their ravages. As I walked the streets that morning, my heart sickened within me ; fathers on their knees besought me to use my influence with the agent, to get them a passage for their families, and mothers held up their emaciated children, with the seal of death upon their sallow faces, in dumb but eloquent appeal — but alas ; I could not help them. Finding that our steamer would be detained some fifteen or twenty days, I at once went on board, glad to escape from the horrors of that very charnel-house, polluted alike by deadly miasmas and by human vice. Lifting our anchor, we sought a more secure harbor under the lee of Flamingo, in one of those secluded little nooks which abound in that locality. Oa the southern extremity of the island of Flamingo, some two hundred feet above the sea, stands a stone cottage of tropic build, whose balconies overhang the bay, and through whose halls the air gently circulates, forming a most cool and delight-

The real and the imaginary West are about as like and unlike each other as the actual abo rigines and the sentimental creations of the novelist's brain which pass under the name of Indian. Men and newspapers talk very glibly about emigrating and going to the West, as if it were a pleasant trip, or a friendly visit to one's rich relations ; little thinking of the suffering, and disappointment, and waste of life attending the migration. There are no statistics on the subject that I know of, and if there were, I doubt whether the reader would place much faith in United States' figures; but disease makes sad havoc among the early settlers in the wilderness, and even in the villages and towns of the West. The perfectly healthy prairie and forest emit a poisonous miasma when their virgin soil is disturbed by the plough ; pale, yellow, haggard faces become quite fa miliar ; ague, chills and fevers are thought nothing of, or at least spoken of lightly, although they finally ruin the constitution, and break up many a too hard-working family. Of the able-bodied men who go to the West and take to farming, the majority, I fear, are entirely disappointed ; although they may have promoted the growth of the country and raised the value of land, and many of them will have accumulated more for their children than they would have done at home. The subject of European emi gration, however, is too interesting and important to be entered upon in the few remaining pages of this volume.

The town of St. Joseph lies to the left, on a wooded spur of the mountain ridge, which rises behind into the lofty peak of Maraccas, 3000 feet high. The population of the ancient capital of Trinidad does not now exceed a thousand individuals. Its houses are neatly built, and are chiefly occupied by descendants of the Spaniards, who were the first discoverers and possessors of the island. There are barracks for soldiers, the scene of a mutiny of one of the black West India regiments, in 1838. They were chiefly new men, lately enrolled from a band of captured Africans, and still retaining their savage habits and tastes. Forty were killed in the suppression of the outbreak by the local militia. Sir Walter Raleigh captured St. Joseph, in 1595, in one of his memorable voyages. Now its inhabitants peacefully pursue the culture of the surrounding hills and Savan- nahs. In the plains below are sugar estates, and gardens for the growth of ground provisions, chiefly in the occupation of Chinese immigrants, who are far more prompt than the free negroes to avail themselves of the profitable markets for vegetables, yams, and other farinaceous products which the island presents. There are abundant openings for advantageous culti vation of this kind, as, at present, a very large portion D 2

Amidst the destruction of so much property, not the least irreparable Avas the loss of all official documents and records. The whole island felt the shock, and shared the disastrous effects of a visitation Avhich happily stands alone in the history of Jamaica, no other, either before or since, having been known to compare Avith it.

"The sentence of 'desolation Avas, however, but partially fulfilled ; a noxious miasma, generated by the shoals of putrefying bodies that floated about the harbour, or lay in heaps in the suburbs, slew thousands of the survivors. As if that so fearful a warning might not be forgotten by posterity, the sunken houses of Port Royal remain permanent memorials of Divine justice, being in calm weather still Arisible beneath the surface of the ocean." From all I can see of it, the present town stands a very good chance of coming to a similar end. g 2

Nobody would give them work, nobody would make purchases in their shops. Then the Crimean war broke out. An American missionary, of the name of Hammelin, I think, took to the baking business, learned how to build ovens and bake bread according to a newly-discovered and improved method ; erected, with money borrowed for the purpose, several ovens of this kind in Constantinople ; proposed for and received a monopoly for the supply of the French army with bread; communicated his method to his oppressed Armenian brethren in the faith; erected large bakeries; carried on an immense business; and, at the close of the war, had the satisfaction, not only of seeing his young community in good circumstances, but also, after having refunded his borrowed capital, was able to make over to the mission a balance of twenty thousand dollars, or francs, I am not sure which ; but that is of little consequence. The important part, and that which is worthy of observation, is the manner in which the American missionary proceeds in his vocation, of which the above example is a splendid proof. They teach both to pray and to labour, and they themselves set the example ; therefore their success is everywhere greater than is that of the missionaries who believe that everything is done merely by spiritual instruction. In company with my young American lady friends, I one day visited the forest of Belgrade, which is a glorious old primeval forest of oak, beech, and chestnut-trees, situated at an hour's distance from this place, and only five or six from Constantinople. And this magnificent forest, of many miles in circumference, is a home for jackals and miasma, and the most beautiful trees rot in its wilderness, whilst firewood in Constantinople is

The inhabitants are both healthy, and look so, and strangers frequently observe, that in the oldest the lines of age come late in life, or seem deferred. The rich, champaign, beautiful, and highly-cultivated vale of Melrose, occupies the site of what was once an ancient lake. From east to west, whenever the ground is turned up, this is manifest by the deposits met with, which consist of pebbles, water stones, and fresh water sand-beds, lying in many places quite contiguous to the surface. The general formation is Graywacke, especially northwards ; to the south we find whinstone, conglomerate, and other varieties of sandstone. This once magnificent sheet of water extended at one period from the bight of land by Melrose bridge to beyond Newstead, a distance of two miles, and from the grassy slopes of the Eildon to the fertile ranges of Gattonside. It was, in fact, a great basin or reservoir of the Tweed, and so existed for a long period until some phenomena burst the eastern barrier and liberated the pent-up waters. The Tweed has not always pur sued an undeviating course in this locality. At one period it sallied on, in joyous mood, much nearer the town and abbey of Melrose than at present. In some places it has retired nearly a hundred yards from the

Strange to say, the natives bear their wirde with indifference, few of them even attempting a remedy ; and those who do, resort to one that might kdl a horse — namely, a draught of a pound of melted butter on an empty stomach. Occasionally, but rarely, the fevers become malig nant and fatal ; but, generally speaking, they are not dangerous, and years may intervene before a person is again attacked. To cite my own experience, after two successive years of attacks during the rains, I have been allowed a respite of nine years without a symptom. A dose of butter, and burning with a hot iron when suffering from internal pain, are the grand remedies at the command of the nomades and the bulk of the people. The fakeers' doctoring propensi ties I have alluded to ; and in addition, in the towns, a few persons professing a knowledge of herbs assume to themselves the power of healing. In addition to the wirde, as in all hot climates, diarrhœa, dysentery, liver - complaints, and Guinea wrorm, are the prevailing diseases ; the most disastrous of all is smallpox.

(242.) The great northern plain of the old continent occupies an area of between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 of square mdes. From Belgium, through HoEand (much of which lies actuaEy below high-water mark), and North Germany and Prussia to the Vistula, we find a cultivated though sandy sod, with large tracts of heath interspersed, and presenting over aE the area bordering on the North Sea and the Baltic, the phenomenon of granitic and syenitic blocks scattered in abundance, not umformly, but in patches here and there, and referable as then origin to the older igneous rocks of the ScanE navian mountains — a phenomenon first brought into prominent notice by Deluc (Geol. Travels), and since recived as one of the chief supports of the "Glacier Theory." (243.) At the Vistula may be said to commence the great Sarmatian, or East European plain, which, with exception of the Valdai HiEs, extends from the Baltic to the Black and Caspian Seas, and to the Ural Mountains. It may be Evided into three regions — a northern ex tending along the coasts of the GuB of Bothnia and Fin land, and the White Sea, and incluEng aE the region north of the Valdai to the middle of the Ural.

SURFACE OF THE TOWN — SOIL — PRODUCTIONS — MINERALS — MAR- BLE — BUILDING STONE — SLATE — MINERAL SPRINGS — QUALITIES OF THE WATER GENERALLY. The surface of Cornwall is more uneven than that of the towns bordering on the Lake, though it has perhaps no more waste land. We have the rocky ridge called "the Ledges," commencing near the centre of the town, and running northward to its northern limit. This ridge is too precipitous for cultivation, and a portion of it even for pasturage, while mush of it is well adapted to feed ing sheep, and the remainder is productive as woodland. In this ridge, east of Cyrus Abernathy's is a cave known as " Rock Rimmon," of no great pretensions as a curiosity, but which yet is visited by the school children, and which, at an early day, sufficiently attracted settlers to secure it a name, and repeated men tion in the surveys and deeds of land in that vicinity. Gen. Ben ton, as we have had occasion to notice, owned a tract of several hundred acres lying west of this locality, which was sometimes designated in the records as his " Rock Rimmon " lot. If we have hills. wre have no marshes to breed miasma, nor swamps, except a tract in the southeast part of the town, which, for its timber, is fast becoming most valuable land, and which, when suitably drained, will become highly productive as meadow. This is indeed already true of an extensive tract, already reclaimed, upon Otter Creek.

XIX.] SAVED BY TOBACCO-SMOKE. 211 The fact seems almost miraculous, and I should have doubted the nature of the malady had it not been ac knowledged and dreaded by every one, the natives as well as ourselves. I can only account for our immunity by the free use of tobacco. What a luxury as well as safeguard in this pest-house was tobacco ! Every one smoked it. It was so cheap as to be within the reach of all ; for if any one was so absolutely destitute as to be unable to procure it, he was liberally supplied by his neighbours. There is hardly a person in the kingdom who does not smoke. I observe, in reading an account of a recent mission to the Court of Ava, by Captain Yule, that the King and Queen both smoked cigars while seated on the Throne, even at a state reception, and that it is no breach of etiquette, either in a stranger or a subject, to smoke a cheroot during an audience, though I never saw this attempted.* Our prison imitated the example of the Palace — the atmo sphere was often so beclouded that it had the appear ance of the densest fog,* — it overpowered all hurtful miasma, that of smallpox not excepted ; and such was our faith in its purifying properties, that we did certainly smoke with increased vigour while the infected person was in our company. Irrespective of infective disease, the effluvium from so many bodies in a confined space might have created deadly evils, but for the coun teracting force of tobacco-smoke. We all acknowledged that we were indebted to it for the preservation of our lives. As each scrap of intelligence arrived from the seat of war, or as any change or caprice influenced the mind of * Yule's Embassy, page 85.
003562471	003562471_305	298 APPENDIX. contributing its superiority, physical and moral, its indomitable strength and energy of character — we would simply mention a few traits of resemblance which incon testably prove that the "child is father to the man." The old Scandinavian possessed an innate love of truth ; much earnestness ; respect and honour for woman ; love of personal freedom ; reverence, up to the light that was in him, for sacred things; great self-reliance, combined with energy of will to dare and do ; perseverance in over coming obstacles, whether by sea or land; much self denial, and great powers of endurance under given cir cumstances. These qualities, however, existed along with a pagan thirst for war and contempt of death, which was courted on the battle-field that the warrior might rise thence to Valhalla. To illustrate the love of freedom, even in thought, which characterises the race, it can be shewn that, while the Celtic nations fell an easy prey to the degrading yoke of Romish superstition, spreading its deadly miasma from the south, the Scandinavian nations, even when for a time acknowledging its sway, were never bound band and foot by it, but had minds of their own, and sooner or later broke their fetters. In the truth-loving Scandin avian, Jesuitical Rome .has naturally ever met with its most determined antagonist; for " True and tender is the North." In the dark days of the Stuarts, witness the noble struggles of the Covenanters and the Puritans for civil and religious liberty. Notwithstanding mixtures and amalgamations of blood, as a general rule the distinctive tendencies of race

The exact value of the popular expressions, " bracing and relaxing air," it would not be easy to express, as they involve more of personal feeling than of facts that can be expressed by figures, diagrams, or words. There cannot, however, be a doubt, that the change experienced in removing for a time from Guernsey to Sark, is exceedingly marked, and almost always favourable. How far a continuance in the same place for a longer time would be of advantage seems doubtful ; but still the simple habits of life that prevail, the inducements to constant exercise in the open air, and the absence of a large population crowded into a small space, cannot but be favourable elements, and must produce their effect. The winds, although not always pleasant, ensure a thorough ventilation and incessant replacement of the air; so that, except in the immediate vicinity of decaying animal and vegetable matter, there can be no dangerous miasma. As a general remark, it may safely be assumed that all the islands are admirably adapted to restore the health, and strengthen both mentally and bodily the overtaxed energies of the inhabi tants of great cities. They afford a pure clear atmosphere, con taining a large quantity of saline matter and iodine, and the frequent high winds ensure a constant freshness, preventing the depressing effect sometimes accompanying humidity. The ex treme beauty and variety of the scenery, and the infinite variety of interest they present to intelligent persons of all classes, and of all pursuits, cannot fail to prevent the ennui that sometimes destroys the effect of a change of air and scene. For those who love wild nature, Sark, Guernsey, Aldemey and Herm, and the north of Jersey, are inexhaustible. For those who prefer gentler and softer beauties, the interior of Jersey is equally rich.

Upon foreigners its influence is very obvi ous, causing a compression about the head, and an ener vation, which greatly incapacitates the body for all active business ; the atmosphere is thick, raw, and at times feels like the heated air of a furnace. The miasma arising from the lagoons, which exist to some extent near Hono lulu, on the sea side, is blown back upon the land. By the natives it is known as the " sick wind," and with great propriety. It sometimes occurs with sufficient force to destroy their frail habitations, and do much damage to plantations and forests. During the winter season, owing to greater abundance of rain, the leeward portions of the islands present a more verdant aspect. Much of the weather at this time is of the most delightful description ; the sky is cloudless, the atmosphere dry, clear, and brac ing, and the whole system feels the invigorating influence of the change. The moonlight nights are remarkable, and their varied beauty cannot fail to attract the attention of the most indifferent observer. Thunder-storms are of rare occurrence, and light in their nature. No hurricanes or heavy gales have been known. An epidemic prevailed throughout the group in the years 1S03 and 1S04. What its precise cause was has never been ascertained ; but it occasioned a great mortal ity — so much so, that the natives state, the living were not able to bury the dead. Though this is doubtless an exag geration, it proved an active agent in the depopulation of the islands. Since that period, nothing of the kind has appeared. There are but few epidemic diseases, and those mostly of a light character. The mumps have prevailed very generally, and in some cases terminated fatally through mismanagement. The influenza occurs almost annually, but is seldom fatal. The whooping-cough, a few years since, spread through the whole population, but a

The occupants of this Ioav ground and the Parsee Merchants, situated betAveen Nos. 12 and 13, are fully of opinion, that their positions are more unhealthy than the sites on the spurs. This must be effected partly by the numerous palm trees interrupting free circulation and partly by the Ioav stratum of miasma from the surrounding country, being more deleterious than the upper. The only other flat surface is No. 15, which is scarcely to be included in the station, and has been used as a Race Course, it is inundated during the season of flood, and is therefore unfit for sites.

The primary of these determinations I consider to be the cerebral, and the rapidity Avith which the membranes and tissues throw out a serous dis charge forms the fatal type of a disease, Avhich has been so lamentably prevalent in the Bengal Brigade ; — may it be hoped that the devastation effected in this season, may not be repeated in 1844, but where 815 men ofa single Regiment are unfit for duty at one time, who can doubt that a specific concentrated miasma is the cause ? Application to the lancet at an early stage of the exacerbation of fever, aj^pears to me to be the safest mode of quickly checking, or pre venting head symptoms, and Avhen it was not had recourse to until the second or third exacer bation had ensued, the sympathetic gastric irri tation Avas such as to preclude the use of any medicine Avhatever.

But a more interesting part of the subject was the miasma so injurious to life on the marshy shore of Western Africa. Some persons said that if science cannot point out a remedy, it is use less to investigate the causes, but he did not so think ; if science could not point out a remedy, still it could point to something as a palliation of the evil. The presence of the injurious gas was easily tested by the roughest hand, so that places in which it abounded could be avoided ; and if imperative duty rendered it absolutely necessary to go to those places, then plentiful fumiga tions of chlorine gas would effectually destroy the sulphuretted hydrogen. The effect of this gas was not only visible on the Western coast of Africa, but in many places elsewhere, although cot to so great an extent. Might not the jungle fever of India, the periodical fevers of New York and Charlestown in America, and the minor diseases on the coast of Essex, be traced to be effects of this deleterious gas ? It was a well-known fact that the ships in the mouth of the Medway consumed more copper than other ships. Chlorine gas then destroyed the injurious gas, and it was easily made, and the materials very cheap ; the Go vernment had plentifully supplied the African Expedition with the materials necessary for the most perfect chlorine fumigations, and he had the pleasure of believing that his report founded on the analysis of the waters submitted to him, and the precautions taken, had imparted confidence not only to the gallant men who composed that expedition, but also to those who had interested themselves in its welfare, and who had been actuated by the most Christian spirit. He hoped its success would be commensurate to its deserts." It is well known, that in these expectations Mr. Daniels has been sadly disappointed— especially as regards the African expe dition ; yet, his observations are most useful, and deserve the serious attention of medical gentlemen throughout the world.

North from the Eyrie, lie the fine sugar estates of that quarter ; and in the opposite direction is the residence of the Nottingham freed families, of whom I may have occasion to speak hereafter. Frenchman's Key forms, with the main land, a fine sheet of water, just to leeward of their set tlement ; this is called Soper's Hole, the spot to which tradition assigns the primitive town of the colony. Between it and Road Harbour, a distance of three leagues, lies the most unhealthy part of the island ; swamp, jungle, and stagnant water, with the rank vegetation falling year after year to decay in it, combine in producing miasma here. Nearly under where the ridge attains its highest elevation, estimated at 1600 feet, a place that bears the name of Sage Mountain, is situate what they call Road Town. The kraals of Nootka Sound, as depicted in Cook's Voyages, had often drawn my boyish attention, from their utter con trast with everything civilized. But when our vessel anchored about half a league from this, the reality of the picture was at once before me ; the same wild, though artificial, collocation of wood and water to a hair. The little range of houses strewed along the beach then facing us, composes the quarter termed Sandy Bay ; it extends, with one or two breaks, along a line of somewhat less

Such were the sources of excitement which Byron, who experienced them in all their power, has stated to be (next to ambition) the greatest in existence ; and he felt how sweet it was thus to sit, wrapt in the mantle of antiquity, and broider the golden web that fancy weaves, till the glorious tapestry of the past curtains from our view the ills and crosses of the present. Then ' stay, illusion, stay awhile, ' My wilder'd fancy still beguile ;' But no — ' it may not be ; it will not last, ' The vision of enchantment's past :' for Telmessus, like many a scene in civilized life, while it delights the eye, gratifies the mind, and leads captive the imagination, warns the traveller to hasten from its pestilential environs, for plague lurks in its streets ; the plains teem with miasma, disease and death are floating around, and the desolation that has here for centuries prevailed, still marks it a Necropolis. Before we leave this place, we must refer to one more memo rable spot. To the left of the theatre a flight of steps conducts from the water's edge to a large grotto, twenty-one feet in breadth, vaulted over head, and rudely cut out of the solid rock, as repre sented in the accompanying vignette. This grotto is supposed to have been a soothsayer's cave. The upper third of the back wall was hollow and contained a small

Its tem perature is some degrees 'colder than that of Penzance, or of the southern coast, being exposed to cold winds from the N. and N.W. Sea fogs coming from the south are prevalent and somewhat unpleasant, but they are temperate; and, unlike those arising from marshes, con tain no miasma, and are not unwholesome. The air is much charged with saline particles, producing verdure through the greater part both of summer and winter. The soil in general is shallow and light, consisting of decomposed granite and peat earth, and therefore not producing heavy crops of wheat, but it is good dairy land, and yields ample crops of barley, oats, turnips, and potatoes, which are extensively cultivated. The farms are mostly small, and a considerable portion are held on lease for lives. The occupiers of them being often interested in mines, the good cultivation of the soil has not always been considered so great an object as the adaptation of it to their immediate and more profitable purpose of enabling them to keep a few horses to work at the mines, and to draw materials to and from them. On the larger farms the cultivation used to be very bad, but of late years a much-improved system has been successfully adopted ; the drill has been introduced, and as good crops of rota baga turnips for winter feeding, and the supply of the market, are grown here, as in more fertile soils. A custom is very commonly adopted by the farmers of letting cows to dairy-men for £8 a-year for each cow for the season of forty weeks ; thus the farmer saves all the trouble and

A tree had fallen upon him when he first began to wield the axe ; he was alone in the woods, and was jammed down under the tree for the best part of a day, his leg miserably crushed ; sores and ulcers formed, which he could not heal. " By my sole exertions I have built up another log house," said the poor fellow ; " the rude walls are standing, but the most difficult part of the job, the roofing-in, I despair of completing before the winter." Pondering upon the hapless lot of this unhappy man, I wended my way across a rough corduroy road and rude attempt at a log-bridge, over a vile, stinking pond or slough, redolent in marsh, miasma, and putrid air, and swarms of flies. A little beyond this romantic piece of ornamental water, I found my farm, or the sixty acres of clearing in woods, wliich I had walked so far to see. This farm had been cleared by the united exertions of three brothers — Old Country men, of course ; they had expended, according to their own shewing, about one thousand pounds already ; they had oxen, and farm-servants, and horses, and cows, and a loggery and small frame-house ; in short, it was easy to see how they had expended their money. As yet the ground was as full of stumps as ever it could stick — beech, but*- ter-nut, oak, hemlock, and some pine. They thought they had done wonders ; for my own part, when I looked at the dense wall of forest which surrounded their little clearing, I thought by the time tliey had

Chicago — Old block house — Military Land-agent — The Colonel's farm — Ride through the prairies — Indian compass— Prairie flowers — Squire Smaus — The Colonel's friends — Hoosier's camp — Young Men's Association. Chicago, commonly called the city of cities, the capital of the Western world, and sundry high-sound ing titles, too numerous to insert, I found to be a thriving town, situate on a flat marsh, washed by the lake, a muddy river, heavy and abundant showers of rain — dried again by lake winds, prairie winds, and gleams of sunshine. Clambering into one of the train of vehicles sent down from the hotels, I bid the Illinois good morn ing, and whirled over the bridge at full gallop, to the Tremont House. Got established in a single-bedded room, and, having breakfasted, sallied forth to recon noitre. Detesting flats and marshes most cordially, I was far from being enamoured with Chicago ; and the pale visages of the store-keepers and clerks, as they opened their store windows, and peered up and down the streets for customers, told tales of marsh miasma, and all the ills that spread beneath its baleful influence. Nathless, it is contended that Chicago is healthy, and woe betide the luckless wight who maintains to the

The first new snow falls between the 10th and 20th of December, and the ground is free from it about the 1st of May, when the flowers begin to show themselves, as if by magic. The hottest time is from the middle of July to the middle of August, during which time the mercury ranges from 80D to 85° Fahr., in shade at noon, in the city, though at Islamabad, a cooler place, I have seen it at 71° in the shade at noon, on the 29th of July. Much, of course, depends upon situation. On the 18th of August, at 10 o'clock, the thermometer stood at 72° onthe top of theTukt-i-Suliman. Onthe6th ofthe same month, in the shade of the gardens of the Shalimar, it stood at 81°, and at half- past seven in the evening ofthe same day it stood at 69° in the Bagh-i-Delawur Khan. In the beginning of June the average height ofthe thermometer, at eight o'clock in the morning, is 64° Fahr. and, at noon, the mercury rises to 74° in the shade. On the 30th of November, at Suhoyum, or the burning ground, the thermometer stood at 66° in the open air at noon, and the cold increases every day till the first snow falls. I have been twice caught by it. The average cold of the depth of winter is a few degrees only below the freezing point, as the lake is covered with ice, whilst the river, a sluggish stream, is not frozen over. Occasionally, however, as I have remarked elsewhere, Kashmir is visited by a season of far greater severity. Although nothing can be more deliciously soft than the air of the valley, yet, in many places, it is affected by a miasma from stagnant water ; and that of the city is sometimes oppressive and sultry, from want

And how dreadfully disgusting a scene is there not present ed in a London, a Manchester, or a Glasgow church-yard — graves dug deep and dark, and some times wet as a coal-pit, and coffins piled one upon another up to the surface ; and then what confu sion and cutting of unripe graves. And in every town, and village throughout the country, how small is the space allowed even for our richest and most populous landward parishes. And how is it manag ed ? there is no plan kept, setting off on paper the several properties of individuals. The corpse-holes in our cities are not only disgusting to decency and sanctity, but they are plague-spots which contaminate the surrounding atmosphere with the miasma of disease and death. The putrid exhal ations and stench which proceed from this insuf ferable evil, and which prevail more or less in all our metropolitan church-yards, require the prompt interference of parliament to extirpate so mon strous a nuisance. Innumerable graves, partly under the floors of churches, and partly in the open soil, are found to be gorged to the very sur face. Often are the unmouldered coffins disturb ed without scruple, and their mournful deposits, not yet decomposed, are violated by the sexton's

The late Governor, Sir James Stirling, observes of the chmate of South Western Austraha, that — " The chmate around, and to the southward of Les chenault, (Wellington,) is the finest in the world, whe ther it be considered with reference either to health or cultivation. It is free from excessive drought, as may be proved by the abundance of perennial streams ; and this it owes, no doubt, to its geographical position, the conformation of the coast, and the prevaUing winds." The annual or periodical occurrence of the native fires entirely prevent any great accumulation of dead plants or leaves ; besides which, the trees and shrubs of Western Australia do not appear to contain in them selves the same proportion of membranous and mucous substance as those of moister chmates. A tree, if cut or blown down, becomes warped and desicated, but it never rots. The leaves and bark and smaU shoots wiU dry up and crumble into dust, but the trunk continues with httle injury for years. It is generaUy destroyed by native fires. It is a subject for curious speculation, what wiU be the result of the changes which are now gradually taking place in the whole natural economy of this coun try.

While Seneca thought it was so given up to pleasure, that no man could safely dwell in Baiæ, who meant to preserve a proper dominion over his passions. As we entered Baiæ the sun was shining brightly, but its resplendent beams seemed to impart increased visibility to the dark gloomy footsteps of desolation. Where were those thousand gilded domes — those mighty temples — those splendid streets — those elegant court-yards, and magnificent gardens, that were once the glory of Baiæ ? Where were those gay, joyous, laughing crowds, that once thronged the streets of this luxurious town? They were all gone. Not only have its wealthy inhabitants passed away — its elegant structures fallen into ruin; but the very air, once so bland and balmy, has become infected with deadly miasma and pestilential exhalations. Old Ocean has asserted his rights, and swept away those decaying moles which wealth had reared, and now rolls his waves over the foundations of a thousand palaces. I never looked on a more un sightly place than Baiæ now is. It has been swept by the wing of desolation. The heaps of mouldering bricks and broken stones, and masses of rubbish that here and there peer above the long weeds, alone remind you that this is the place where Baiæ, with its splendid palaces and temples, once stood. It is true, there are here the remains of two or three temples, the walls of which are still standing. The temples of Venus and Mercury are in VOL. I. 19

At a little distance on the east of the city an ancient arti ficial mound rises to the height of seventy or eighty feet, and marks the site, as it is said, of the ancient shrine or temple, where in days of yore the renowned Zoroaster kindled his sacred fires, and bowed in adora tion to the heavenly hosts. The climate is naturally very delightful ; but owing to local causes a poisonous miasma is generated, occa sioning fevers and the various diseases of malaria, to which the unacclimated stranger is specially exposed ; and the mission families have suffered much from this cause. My late inestimable wife was the first victim of the climate we were called to mourn ; and in her peaceful and triumphant death, she set the seal to the truths she had so faithfully taught and exemplified in her short but eventful life. She rested from her la bours on the 12th of January, 1839; and her infant twin-daughters now repose by her side within the pre cincts of the ancient Nestorian church in the city of Ooroomiah. In the month of February of that year I received instructions from the Board of Missions to proceed into Mesopotamia, to form a station among the Nes torians dwelling, as was supposed, on the west of the central mountains of Koordistan. By this means it was hoped that a safe way of access might be found to the main body of the Nestorian Christians, the inde pendent tribes which have their abode in the most

It is here that the rivers, rising from opposite sides of this ridge, flow in oppo site directions in their course ; the Tennessee, for instance, flowing south-west, through the State to which it gives its name ; and the Savannah floAving south-east, by the city so called, which stands on its banks near the sea. There are no less than six classes or kinds of soil in this territory : the first of these is the tide swamp, near the sea ; the second is the inland SAvamp, above the reach of the tide-water range ; the third is the high-river swamp ; the fourth is the salt marsh ; the fifth is the hickorv and oak high land ; and the sixtli is the pine barren. In the first tAA-o classes, rice and hemp are chiefly cultivated, as these require wet lands for their growth. In the third, hemp, corn, and indigo, thrive best. The fourth, the salt marshes, are not much used. The fifth grows corn, indigo, and cotton. The sixth is the least fertile of all, and consequently is not much cultivated. In point of healthiness, the high lands are the most salubri ous, and the Ioav lands the least so. In the first three classes, the miasma of the summer is so fatal to European and American constitutions, that all the white planters quit their homes early in May, and do not return again till October, leaving their plan tations during that time to the care of an overseer, and the negro slaves. If the overseer be a AA-hite man, he is almost sure to be attacked Avith fever and ague during the autumn ; and though he may sur vive the attack, every repetition of it makes orCat

English day in June, though now in the early part of February, when the cold in the Chesapeake Avas so severe, as to close the navigation of that noble bay by the ice. At sunrise of the second day we arrived at Edisto, a small village on the northern edge of the island of that name, one of the sea-islands devoted to the cultivation of cotton. And after receiving a supply of fire-wood, we proceeded on our way, vvith increas ing breadth of water, and increasing interest of © * o scenery from the greater variety and abundance of wood ; until, at sun-set we reached the toAvn of Beau fort, or Port Royal, where we remained for an hour to discharge and take in freight and passengers. This is a small place, inhabited chiefly by Avealthy planters, and families in' easy circumstances, Avho come here to reside at certain seasons of the year, for the sake of the sea-breezes, which bloAv through the inlet at the head of which it is situated, and is not at all a place of trade. Its population, Avhite and coloured, does not exceed 1,000 persons. The most healthy spots along the coast are the dry sandy ridges near the sea ; and these preserve their salubrity throughout the summer and autumn ; while, within a mile of such positions, where moisture and decayed vegetation exist, the miasma produces a fever that is fatal to strangers, and very dangerous even to the natives of the soil, who leaA*e these parts to the negroes and a feAv overseers on their estates. At eight o'clock we left Beaufort, and at ten arrived at a place called Hilton Head, the opening of a broader passage, where we anchored for the night ; and getting under Avay at four in the morning, Ave

Another added, that in 1S35, the year in Avhich all the orange-trees in Georgia and Florida Avere killed by the cold, and have never since revived, the ther mometer at Augusta fell to 8° below zero ; but on the average of several years, the range of the ther mometer is found to be from 20°, the loAvest, in January and February, to 90°, the highest, in July and August. About thirty miles before we came to Augusta, Ave passed a steam-vessel lying high and dry in tho Avoods, wdiere she had grounded during a high flood among the trees, and had never been got off since. Just above this, at a wood-landing, called Silver Bluff, were several houses, one of Avhich, near tbe river, on the Carolina side, Avas of two stories, the lower half of brick and the upper half of wood ; but all of them were uninhabited. It has been found here, as in the great river of the Mississippi, that the bluffs, though originally chosen for places of residence from their elevation, are not so healthy as the lower lands. This is accounted for by their exposure to the miasma arising from the swamps on the opposite side of the river. Purisburg and Ebenezer Avere both seated on such bluffs, and have never grown into any size or im portance ; and even Savannah was for many years extremely unhealthy, until the marsh lands opposite to it were purchased by the city, and drained and devoted to a dry culture of the cotton plant, instead of the rice formerly groAvn there. As we approached nearer to Augusta, the signs of cultivation began to appear nearer the river's edge, and through openings in the woods we could per- i. M

In confirmation of the accuracy of this view, it has occurred, that while the yellow fever raged with the greatest violence in New Orleans, no persons living at the Infirmary were affected by it ; and in an interchange of coloured servants that was made betAveen the Doctor's estab lishment in the city, and the Infirmary, it invariably happened that those who went into the city caught the yellow fever, and those who went to the Infirmary escaped. Attached to the hospital, was an interesting mu seum of natural history, commenced by Dr. Luzen berg, particularly in the departments of reptiles and insects peculiar to the country. We had seen a fierce looking wolf, recently caught in the mountains of Tennessee, now chained up in the garden, and some pretty squirrels from the adjoining woods, in their appropriate revolving cages ; but the collections in the museum were of course all lifeless and preserved. Among them were some specimens of the rattle snake, taken in this State, from the length of about twelve inches to four and five feet, and from the circumference of an inch and half to three inches. Its rattle, not at all injured by death, is composed of a series of bony or horny cups, like the bones of the vertebræ, but loose in their sockets. These are ap pended to the extremity of the tail, and terminate the length of the body ; and when the animal is alarmed, or embarrassed, by pursuit or any other cause, it lifts its tail perpendicularly in the air, and shakes it, like
000516654	000516654_497	PURITY OF ATMOSPHERE. 477 Here on thc Alabama, as Avell as on thc Savannah and the Mississippi rivers, these bluffs have been uniformly chosen as places of settlement for toAvns, and stations for dwelling-houses or estates, from a belief in their superior salubrity, of which the ex amples of Savannah, Augusta, Montgomery, Baton Rouge, and Natchez, all of which I had seen, are in point. These heights are noAV generally admitted, however, to be less healthy than the corresponding localities just below them on the rivers' banks. The reason assigned is this — that the miasma of the lower grounds, occasioned by decayed vegetation, being spe cificallv lighter than the atmospheric air, rises above it, and floats on its surface like oil upon water ; so that this noxious atmosphere hangs over the higher cliffs, while the air is much purer beloAv. Whether this be or be not the cause, the effect is unquestion able ; and many a fever and ague are caught in the autumn, by those who remain on the bluffs, that are escaped by those AA'ho live below. Another popular error respecting the change of climate and its causes, seems to exist, which may be worth notice. That the climate of the South has become more cold, and that of the North more humid, seems to be beyond all dispute ; but that the progressive clearing of the lands has been the cause of this change, as generally assumed, has been doubted, and that by very competent authorities. I have before stated, I think, that Dr. Luzenberg, of New Orleans, had observed that marshes and mo rasses were not unhealthy while covered with dense forest, and not only Louisiana, but Arkansas, abound with proofs of this ; but when the process of clearing

The entrance is very narrow, scarcely a quarter of a mile across, but it expands gradually as you proceed upwards, and some beautiful small prairies are seen in the way. These are bordered by pic turesque hills, at distances of from one mile to five from the river-banks, which gives the whole scenery the appearance of that observed on the Upper Ohio ; but this soon passes away, and is succeeded by low, flat, and wooded land, which becomes very monoto nous and uninteresting. The water is very shallow, and the current slow, whilee many parts of the banks on either side are so overflown, that the trees appear to be growing out of the water, the flood extending sometimes for a mile or two inland. It is this which makes the river Illinois a very un healthy stream in the autumnal months, the vast quantity of decayed vegetation, and the miasma of the plains occasioning bilious fevers and ague to be almost universal. These do not begin generally, however, till the lst of August, and they attain their greatest violence in the month of September, when the heat is great, and the water low. In the course of the forenoon, we got aground twice, from the ignorance or carelessness of the pilots, and were detained each time about a couple of hours before we got off again ; while our utmost speed, even after we had cast off the heavy flatboats we had been towing, did not exceed 5 miles in the hour, and made our progress tedious in the extreme. As a specimen of the kind of company into which we m. p *

This is attributed to some change that takes place in their food, and in the condition of the bottom of the river. From the waters being shallow, and the river's bed prolific in the production of long rank grass and weeds, these, when the waters get low, undergo decay like the land plants, and the decomposi tion of their vegetable matter imparts to the water of the river a quality which it is believed kills the fishes in it, and assists, perhaps, in producing the autumnal fevers among the human inhabitants of its banks, as all persons drink of it. This, added to the miasma of the marshes, and decayed vegeta tion of the woods, may account for the almost uni versal prevalence of disease here at that period; when, as we were assured by one of the residents, the sick in the villages were sometimes so numerous, that there were often not a sufficient number of per sons in health to pay the requisite attention to those who were helpless from suffering. The ignorance of the early settlers caused them to believe that rum and tobacco were the best specifics to keep off the ague and fever, and accordingly, drinking and smoking are almost universal here. At many of the places where we stopped to take in wood, we saw the women smoking as frequently as the men, and both with short white clay pipes, and not segars.

They are called Koonch and Rajbunsi, and doubtless are sprung from the same origin as the tribes of the same names in Rungpore and Assam. They are the aboriginal inhabitants of the northern division of the district, and the last remnant in this part of the country of the population of the ancient kingdom of Karoroop, which as has been already observed extended down to the Boorigonga. Dr. B. Hamilton, in speaking of the Koonch and Rajbunsi tribes of Dinagepore, mentions that the tradition there is, that they are Kheytriyos who escaped from the persecution of Prosuram by fleeing to China, and that their princes called " Nor," pretend to be descendants of the god Siva.

It is intersected by numerous creeks that expand out into extensive morasses, in its central parts. The beds of these lower levels consist chiefly of stiff clay, mixed with more or less alluvial deposit, according to their proximity to the inundating rivers, and are mostly covered with rank grass jungle. The elevated kunkar soil is clad with brushwood jungle, and in the interior with clumps of lofty forest trees. From the aborbent pro perty of the argillaceous soil, this tract retains its moisture for a longer time than the alluvial lands, and is the site of heavy fogs on the cessation of the rains, and during the cold season. The city and suburbs present an aspect, The fourth which may be said to be composed of all or the preceding ones. On the east there is an extensive alluvial plain, and on the north and north west a tract of dense tree and brushwood jungle, intersected by the beds of creeks and morasses which are full of water during the rains, forming a connection between the rivers Borigonga and Luckia,

Sickness now begins to prevail, especially in .the form of bowel complaints, which the natives in the city universally ascribe to this contamination of the Borigonga water. As the draining of the country proceeds, the water flows more scantily, but of a darker hue, until at length, the rice plant and aquatic weeds, forming a saturated mass and the latter emitting a most offensive odour, fall to the ground and give rise to malaria, and fever. Malaria is most abundantly evolved from the middle of Sep tember to the end of November ; the season in which the elements of decomposition or the proportions of water and dead vegetable matter, and a certain degree of temperature appear to be in the most favorable adaptation for the production of this agent. With the soil now saturated with moisture and covered with a thick layer of decaying vegetable matter, there occurs at this time, a state of atmospheric quiescence which appears greatly to contribute to the elaboration of marsh miasma. For sometime preceding and fol lowing the gale or stormy weather that usually occurs on the change of the monsoon, the wind becomes light, and variable, calms are more frequent than at any other season of the year, and the range of temperature begins to increase. During the day, the sky is gene- 2 s

A physician also communicated to the Editor of the Papers, a written statement respecting a lady whom he attended in St. John Street, stating that, during her residence there, she was afflicted with a protracted fever, of the type usually occasioned by marsh miasmata ; and that he found it absolutely necessary to remove her to another lo cality, when it subsided; any thing short of that, though long persevered in, having been quite unsuccessful. (Ibid. p. 58.) The case of the Reverend Principal Lee, while residing in that vicinity, has been already referred to. Although the term malignant, applied to the fever which afflicted his fa mily, does not enable us to specify its particular nature, yet the attendant circumstances make it probable that both it and the dysentery under which he suffered, arose from ma larian influence. This opinion is strengthened by the report of two cases of fever communicated by Dr. Huie. Some years ago, he attended the manager of the Caledonian Dairy Company and his servant maid, then residing at Meadow bank. Neither of these persons, says Dr. Huie, had been exposed to contagion ; they were attacked simultaneously with a violent fever, which required the most energetic treat ment. Both patients recovered ; and at that time and now Dr. Huie is convinced that both cases arose from malaria. They occurred in the latter end of July, when the weather was very warm, and the noisome exhalations from the irri gated lands in the vicinity were very offensive. (Papers, p. 36.) In several instances, Mr. Miller, who resides in the King's Park, and different members of his family have been seized with severe remittent fever, which was uniformly at tributed to the noxious exhalations to which they were there exposed. (Ibid. p. 58.) Formerly, in England, intermittent fevers were very com mon. In the year 1765, between four and five hundred persons, afflicted with that disease, fell under the care of Dr. Lind alone, then acting as physician at Haslar Hospital ;

One would expect, in such a paral lel, excessive evaporation, and much unwhole some miasma ; but it is neither sultry nor pestilen tial, and there is a constant play of air passing over the place, from or to the sea. Mr. Crawford, the second governor of Singapore, seemed to la bour to depress the credit of the island, and even denied that it could yield anything but gambier ; it was too sterile, he declared, to raise corn or rice enough for its occupants, and could never be profitable ; but it has, happily, been found to be quite the reverse, and the present enterprising American consul, Mr. Balestier, has done more than any other to develope the resources of the island, and to extend its credit abroad. In a pub lished series of letters on Singapore, Mr. Balestier says : "It is a most felicitous place for agriculture, since the planters may sow and reap the year round, excepting in January and February, when the rains of the year principally fall. But the face of Nature is ever refreshed by showers, vegeta tion is ever active, and the forest, and the field yield, side by side, at the same time, flowers, shoots, and fruits — a deep glossy verdure spreads over the land the whole year, and marks it as a land over which the dogstar shines, but shines innocuous. Its twinkling rays descend, but they bring neither drought nor fire, and Nature is ever young." Mr. Balestier has ascertained, by his own pioneering experiments, that the sugar cane will flourish there with even more success than in the West Indias; and plantations of nutmeg, pep per, coffee, and other valuable plants, now prom ising to thrive equally well, are opened extensive ly all over the island, although the government

It vanished as we ap proached ; but no sooner did one gauze-like screen disappear, than in succession another and auother was discovered. The vapour cloud was seen against the clear azure sky, struggling to gain the higher regions. But not a breath of wind shook the long grass jangal, and the marsh miasma, if such it were, rose but to a certain height and there became sta tionary, floating above the spot where it had risen. At nine in the evening we forded the river, and im mediately afterwards arrived in Khana-i-bad, the summer residence of Murad Beg. The stream abreast of the town runs in two channels. That on the west bank, though only three feet deep, was so rapid as nearly to unhorse me. With some difficulty, however, I escaped ; but the Munshi was less fortunate, and got a complete ducking. Its width did not exceed fifteen yards, but its velocity was fully five miles an hour. The other branch had a width of sixty yards, and ran immediately under the walls of Khana-i-bad. It now discharged but little water, for though the principal course of the river, the stream had lately been led into another channel, while the bridge across it was under repair. It was late when we entered the village, and to the hospitality of some ofthe students in its Madrasa, or colleges, we were indebted for shelter and for firing. Our horses were soon stabled in a corner of the court-yard, and, having seen that their provender

Though the green-sodded hills around invite them to encamp where the air is pure and the breeze healthy, they prefer the swamp and its miasma, and will not purchase health at the price of a certain degree of extra labour. It is no doubt convenient to them to reside in the midst of their cultivated fields ; but the very circumstances which cause the extreme fertility of those fields render them deadly to man ; to those, at least, who have not been gradually seasoned to the region ; nor can any advantages which the husbandman obtains by residing on the low grounds be worth the risk which he incurs. Since the year 1830, Badakhshan and the countries subject to or rather " chuppowed" by Murad Beg, on the northern bank of the Oxus, have been depopulated to stock the plains of Kunduz and Hazrat Imam. The aggre gate of foreigners thus forcibly planted in these un healthy marshes from that year to the present time, is estimated by the Uzbeks at 25,000 families, or in round numbers, 100,000 souls; and I question whe ther of these 6,000 were alive in 1838 ; so great had been the mortality in the short space of eight years. Truly may the proverb say, Agur moorda mekhie — Koondooz burrow ; "If you wish to die, go to Kun duz." Twelve months antecedent to our visit, a great portion of the inhabitants of Kulab were brought from their own hilly country down to Hazrat Imam. Dr. Lord and myself walked over the ground which their straw kirgahs had covered,

Before starting, the officers of the station strongly endeavoured to persuade me not to attempt to go through the awful jungle which lies between this and Jubbulpoor ; for, at this season of the year, the breaking up of the monsoon, when the sun comes out again with redoubled vigour, produces a strong, damp miasma from every species of vegetation, and is peculiarly dangerous. Many indeed told me they would not attempt the journey now for 10,000 rupees. I replied that I could not justify at home the fact of my remaining so long inactive, neither could I con tent myself with being idle, so, in spite of all dangers and obstacles, I sent my baggage forward on bullocks. Dispatched my letters to England yesterday, and to-day the 10th, I set out for Jubbulpoor — halting for the night five cos from Kamptee. 11th. Travelled six cos. Halted at a large chowrie in the jungle. Went out tiger shooting, taking with me a Shikarree man, experienced in the intricacies of the jungle, to whom I promised bucksheesh if he would shew me a tiger. This man, after eyeing me intently for a moment, said " he thought Master would run " away on seeing the game." I replied, " Shew me a " tiger, you shall receive your bucksheesh, and shall " see whether I run away." Accordingly with his long fusille and lighted rope, with which he fires his gun, he proceeded to the jungle, giving me his instructions how to act. I was to follow him closely behind, never to get abreast of him, and when he pointed out the tiger to take a deliberate aim, and then if the animal was not hit mortally he would fire himself. We
002466368	002466368_46	39 CLIMATE. Considered in a sanatory point of view, there arc few towns more advantageously situate than Brighton. The air is 'dry and bracing, and remarkably free from miasma arising from vegetable decomposition, or the vicinity of marsh lands. The dryness of the air is a natural consequence of the nature of the soil on which the town is built. On the east it consists of chalk ; in tho valley of the Steine the chalk is covered with a layer of shingle; about West Street the natural soil is clay, which gradually increases in depth. The clay has, however, been so excavated for building and brick-making, that little or no inconvenience is experienced from the retention of moisture by the soil, especially when we take into consideration the artificial character of the roads and esplanade, which do not retain moisture, and the gravelly soil of the country to the west. The northern part of the valley of the Steine is less dry ; for in the month of February, when the land springs rise, the little stream called the Wellsbourne, which flows from Patcham and Preston, and thence pursues an underground course to the sea, sometimes overflows the road, and the kitchens of the houses in the neighbourhood. This inconvenience has, however, been greatly ameliorated of late, by the formation of a sewer sufficiently large to carry off the superfluous water. Medical men, who have written on the sanatory effects of Brighton air, have divided the town into three districts, each of which possesses a different climate. The eastern division is characterised by its extreme dryness and the bracing quality of the air, which, except during high winds, is exempt from the saline particles which are suspended in the atmosphere of the lower parts of the town. The central portion, according to Dr. Wigan, " differs but little from any inland town in a low situation, and possesses none of the quality called bracing."* This division comprehends the old part of the town, in which are situated the principal shops and factories ; from its central situation, this dis- * " Brighton and its Three Climates," 1845.
002466368	002466368_48	41 have a marked effect upon tho salubrity of the whole town, name ly, the entire exemption from the miasma arising from marshes, and from the delta of rivers. It is also free from the decom position of vegetable matter, and of the manure with which garden grounds are frequently dressed in the vicinity of towns, and which too often proves a fertile source of fevers. The changes of temperature at Brighton are very great, the thermometer, on the same spot, sometimes varying from ten to fifteen degrees in a few hours. I say on the same spot, because the temperature which prevails in different parts of the town, varies in proportion to their exposure to the sun or wind. On the Cliff one may experience the warmth of Naples, while through the streets which have an opening north and south, a stream of cold air rushes, which seems to proceed from the icy regions of the north. The common expression, that there is a great-coat difference between the Cliffs and the transverse streets, during the prevalence of the north wind, scarcely expresses the great variation of temperature ; the one is frequently summer, the ether winter. The invalid cannot be exposed to these changes with impunity, and the pleasure of sunning one's self on the espla nade leading to the Chain-pier, where, on a winter day, the ther mometer stands at 55° or 60°, is dearly purchased by the icy blast which one encounters on emerging from this sheltered spot. It is safer in these cases, either to remain within doors, or to abstain from visiting the most inviting, but treacherous promenade upon the Cliff. When Brighton first became fashionable as a watering place, " the season " began early in June, and closed with the first days of November. Since that time the fashionable arrivals have been later and later, and at the present time, visitors of the highest rank seldom arrive here before November ; they remain until the middle of December, and sometimes until the beginning of February; thus converting Brighton from a summer into a winter residence. But as the arrival of one Swallow does not make a summer,

She was the first white woman I had ever seen who had placed her hand in that of a thick-lipped, long-heeled negro. " We soon concluded our business and again continued our walk. We saw nothing more than has been written of by dozens of previous writers, and I will therefore step at once upon the beach on our return to the boat. We experienced a sense of indescribable relief as we left the dirty streets and thin half-clad occupants behind us, and drew long breaths of the freshening sea-breeze before it had been contaminated by their ever-exhaling miasma. " That night I kept the mid-watch ; and, while it was rolling slowly by, a ship's light made its appearance around the point to seaward, and shortly after the dark hull, lofty spars, and white sails of a frigate loomed through the surrounding gloom, holding her steady way across our stern. " ' Ship ahoy!' hailed a hoarse voice. " ' Hillo !' I answered. " ' What ship's that V " I gave our name, and the hoarse voice returned theirs.

As she crossed our stern and rounded to on our quarter, she burnt a blue-light to satisfy herself as to the

The streams which are now so insignificant would then be considerably increased by systematic drainage of the neighbouring land, and when combined would form a river large enough to produce the result attributed to it. When under the auspices of Epaminondas the Man tineans returned from their villages, they built the walls on their former site. The local attachment so powerful among Greeks,1 the veneration for the temples and altars, and the claims of families to the sites and ruins of the former houses, would all combine to induce them not to build a new city, but rebuild the old ; and the presence of polygonal masonry in the walls and theatre tends to confirm this supposition. The same is implied in the language of Pausanias, who tells us, that after the sur render of the city some small part of it was still left in prj 8ia Teixasv irorapov -noieiaOai.

Thither the peasants repair at nightfall to repose, as their ancestors, in earlier times, rested during their migrations and battles. Hungary embraces two immense plains, surrounded by boulevards of lofty mountains. Parts of these, rival ling in fertility the prairies of the West, are dotted with villages and ocean-like fields of grain. Here and there also are wide pampas, grown up with luxuriant grass, upon which a solitary horseman is occasionally to be se#n. Bordering the Danube are immense marshy tracts, submerged in the spring, and grazed during the months of summer by herds of dun-colored cattle. None but the most hardy venture into this region of gloom, and solitude, and fatal miasmas. Farther back, especially between the Danube and the Theiss, is a vast plain, forming a veritable desert. It is Africa in Europe. For weary, weary leagues the horizon is unbroken by a tree or a human habitation. Shrubs and tufts of coarse wiry grass take root wherever moisture can be found for their support. Above is a fervid and brassy sky, below a parched and arid soil. By day the sun hangs over the inhospitable waste like a burning meteor ; by night chilly exhalations creep over it from the marsh lands, poisoning the air, and misguiding the lonely traveller with their flickering ignes fatui. The winds that sweep over the pusztas, for by that name the Hungarians designate these plains, fill i#

Steaming down the ancient Ister, every hour carried me further within the portals of the sultry Orient. Be low Widdin, the Danube varies from half a mile to two miles in width, and rolls away to the Euxine, as calm and sluggish as the pale rivers of the North. The long reaches of the Amazon could scarcely have been more monotonous, as horn- after hour we held on our winding course. Multitudes of cranes and pelicans, frightened from their grotesque positions by the splash of the steamer, took refuge in the Wallachian swamps, while an occasional eagle from the Carpathians wheeled above us in airy circles, undisturbed by the presence of man. Here and there the northern shore is fringed with immense morasses, the home of wolves, and bears, and poisonous miasmas. Beyond, stretches away the low Wallachian plain, a magnificent field for the moving of armies ; and in the far distance the eye sometimes catches sight of the gentle undulations which swell into the Carpathians. The vast level tracts of Daco- Romania are connected with the Steppes of Bessarabia, and are open to the winds that sweep across the plains of Southern Russia. Rising, in several instances, to the height of six thousand feet, the Carpathians form an almost uninter-

Though his grave be unmarked from the mass of mortality by which it is surrounded, yet he has built up for himself a monumen tum œre perennius, by his great discovery of the mouth of the river Niger. The brushwood is remarkably dense, as if vegetation assumed new life from the many dead bodies underneath. The peak of Fernando Po is more than ten thousand feet above the level of the sea ; and I believe the mountain to possess all the varieties of temperature, as well as of vegetation, to be met with from the equator to the poles. The palm-tree, the banana, the plan tain, orange, and all kinds of intertropical fruits, flourish on the low ground. Higher up, satin-wood, lignum-vitæ, and mahogany grow, with cinnamon and tamarinds ; whilst, ascending farther, cloves are found, and, near the summit, myrtles and lichens. The upper part of the mountain is said to abound in wild peacocks. The late Governor Beecroft made an ascent of it in 1840, and so intense was the cold at the peak, that two of his negro servants died on their return to Clarence. The thermometer was down to 40° Fahr. From this it may be presumed that an hospital could be erected here, in a position to be above all the endemic influences of the country, as the fever miasma is never known to rise higher than 2000 feet above the level of its germi nation. North-West Bay is situated about thirty-five miles from Clarence in the direction which its name indicates. It has also been called George's Bay, in honour of N 4

Ever entertaining a belief that there is no accli matising fever in Western Africa, the following extract from Dr. Bry son's* work strengthens my opinion on this subject: — "In the report of the 'Atholl' in 1829, which had been stationed in the Bights, it is remarked that the cases of fever have recovered much more slowly of late than formerly (a twelvemonth ago), so that, instead of its being an advantage to be acclimatised, it is appre hended it will be found quite the reverse ; for the sys tem becomes relaxed and debilitated by the enervating influences of the climate, and consequently it is more difficult to restore it to a state of health and vigour." The faith of Fordyce, with reference to persons becom ing hardened to the effects of the malarious or contagious principle, is only true in Africa of cases where the malaria has not become developed into any form of the fever. When the human constitution is acclimatised, it is most effectually accomplished without fever ; but, very frequently, idiosyncrasy of the patient, or a combination of powerful predisposing causes, will tend to the conver sion of miasma into a continued remittent or inter mittent attack. " In proportion as the body is weakened or exhausted, it yields more readily to the pernicious influence of contagion or malaria ; but by obviating all * Report on the Climate and Principal Diseases of the African Station.

As early as half-past two a.m., the country people, Avith their carts laden Avith fruit, provi- sions, &c, assemble in crowds at the octroi boundary; in a few minutes they have passed, and business has begun. The large market-place is literally swarming with gaily-attired men, women, and girls, each superin- tending their little divisions of flowers, fruit, and vege- tables. Here are to be seen in profusion, according to the season, citrons, almonds, lemons, oranges, cherries, tomatas, mushrooms, olives, grapes, chestnuts, green figs, and melons ; and in the flower-market, orange flowers, heliotrope, magnolia, jasmine, &c. There is a sound as of Babel ; every one gesticulating, talking, bargaining, selling and buying, at the same moment. The harbour need not be closely inspected by any one not curious in odours, as it is a floating repertoire of all that is abominable. There are two high barren rocky cliffs, which, rising on each side, guard it like sentries. From the south one (Notre Dame de la Garde) there is a fine view of the Mediterranean and the small islands clustered near ; but it is a tedious and fatiguing ascent. In the evening, the cafes and restaurants should be explored. Almost every nation has its representative in this city, and no costume seems strange ; there are Kaffirs, Turks, Neapolitans, Indians, Anglo-Indians, military men of all European armies, Moors, Italians, Americans, &c. Every sort of cooking is to be had, and eArery language is spoken. But in spite of all these attractions, it must be owned that mosquitoes and creeping things abound, that fevers are not uncommon, and the miasma at

Coming from countries where beauty was so scarce, the charms of my fair countrywomen ap peared to great advantage on my return home. In deed, on first again walking in the streets of London it seemed impossible to cast my eye on an ugly woman. Had I continued long thus susceptible I know not what might have been the consequence ; but by setting one against the other, the impression gradually faded into a neutral tint. The disagree able features and misshapen limbs, that prevad to such an extent among the natives of Switzerland, have been attributed to the unhealthiness of the ice water which pours down from the glaciers, and the malaria and dews which rise in the valleys, more especially where the streams empty themselves into the lakes. The " debouchement" of the Rhone into the Lake of Geneva is particularly unhealthy : in the rustling sedges lurk pestilence and miasma, which at nightfall stalk like spectres across the misty swamps ; and the whole length of the valley, through which this river flows, is infested with victims to " goitre" and "cretinism." Of these two afflicting diseases, the latter to my mind is far the worst. It is inexpressi bly shocking to contemplate a being, human indeed in form, but in whose face all trace, not only of in tellect, but even of human expressoin is wanting. Cretinism is not confined to Switzerland, but is more

" I was overcome by joy and pride," writes the Marshal ; "I admired the soldiers whom it was my task to conduct to victory." The young recruits had already caught from their seniors of the African army their freedom of move ment, and almost the bronzed hue of their counte nances. In the bivouacs, the old soldiers, habituated to camps, became the teachers of their inexpe rienced comrades.

The bulk of the troops, were, therefore, encamped at a distance from the town. Movement and noise have replaced the sepulchral silence of the Ottoman towns and the lethargic sleep of the inhabitants.1 The works on the lines i Workmen were employed every day to clear out the port and the dock, to construct landing-places and jetties, to level the streets and squares, to establish provisional hospitals, to construct barracks, and to dig ditches to render the town healthy. All these works were done with surprising activity. The Turks were stupified, amazed ; and asked themselves what demon it was that urged us on. They did not understand that it is the work of the arms which saves and fortifies the life of the body.

On the slope of the south bluff, a little way out of the town, stands the State asylum for the insane. The Susquehanna is crossed by two bridges, one budt by the Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad Company, their line coming up the south bank of the river, and crossing here. The other bridge is interest ing from its appearance. There is an island, with a small farm upon it, in the middle of the stream. The bridge from the south bank to the island is a very old one, and rises high in the middle ; while the remain ing portion from the island to the north bank is new, and level. Both have piers. The bed of the river is rock, and the water is not above four or five feet deep Fronting the river there is a terrace of good houses, with the unfading row of shade-trees in front. The look-out on the river is pretty, and the locality appears desirable ; but it seems that in summer miasma prevails, and ad the banks of the Susque hanna are unhealthy. From the water-reservoir, which is on the ridge already mentioned, a good idea is obtained of the flat aduvial plain around, and the distant hills. The gap through which the river comes is about five miles distant, and from this looks like a clean-cut notch in the range. The more distant hids are seen through it like a light curtain in the back ground. The State-house is a plain brick building, with a dome, and Ionic portico.

To each of these cities, and, consequently, to ad places beyond them, the navigation is liable to frequent stoppage, — in summer, from want of depth of water; and in winter, from ice. This *point is, therefore, likely to become a great shipping-place for produce going south, and for merchandise, &c, coming from New Orleans ; whde the saving to passengers going to Cincinnati and St Louis is such, that they are already preferring to land at Cairo and go by radway, although, in the present state of the connecting lines, this route is a long one. A company was formed in 1841 to budd a city at Cairo, but after getting two or three houses erected, it broke up. The place got the name of being "stuck," and people became prejudiced against it. It was said to be a swamp, unhealthy, &c. A new company has recently been formed, caded " The Cairo City Property Company," which is possessed of ad the land for nearly seven miles north from the point; and through their exertions, and the opening of the radway, atten tion is again turned to Cairo. It is confidently stated, that the spot is less unhealthy than many other points on the river, where large towns have sprung up. The trustees have cut down the timber on the flats from river to river, for a considerable space ; and this permits of the free cdcidation of air, and has driven away the miasma, which produced chills and fever. Last sum mer, when there was so much cholera in the other towns on the Ohio and Mississippi, there was not one case of it among the inhabitants of Cairo.

Well may it be asked whether the prophecy of Pope is not at length on the eve of fulfilment : — " She comes ! she comes ! the sable throne behold, Of Night primeval and of Chaos old, As, one by one, at dread Medea's strain, The sickening stars fade off the ethereal plain — As Argus' eyes, by Hermes' wand oppressed. Close one by one in everlasting rest. Thus, at her felt approach and secret might, Art after art goes out, and all is night." The anti-scientific influences of the principle have, however, not been restricted to the cloisters of the University. They have been creeping of late over the surface of English society, as that sulphurous fog, into which the arch-fiend in Milton transformed himself when he sought to dash creation into chaos, crept of old over the surface of Eden. The singularly extended front of opposition presented last autumn by the newspaper press of England to the British Association, when holding its sittings at Southampton, and the sort of running fire kept up for weeks after on its more distinguished members — men such as Sir Roderick Murchison, Dr. Buckland, and Mr. Lyell — seem to have been an indirect consequence of a growing influence in the country on the part of the revived superstition. One of the earliest assaults made on the Association, as hostile in its nature and tendencies to religion, appeared several years ago in the leading organ of Tractarianism, the "British Critic;" but the " Critic " in those days stood much alone. Now, however, though no longer in the field, it has got not a few successors in the work, and its party mfiny an active ally. The mediæval miasma, originated in the bogs and fens of Oxford, has been blown aslant over the face of the country ; and not only religious but scientific truth is to experience, it would seem, the influence of its poisonous blights and rotting mildews.

The bedchamber of our two children measures 17 x 12 x 8, and contains, therefore, rather better than 1600 cubic feet of air; but here there is not even a stove, nor any perforation whatever in the walls, so that if their lungs exhaled the same amount of poison as is evolved by a full-grown person, they would be stifled in their beds long before their 10 hours' sleep was ended. Our servant's bedroom measures 9x7x8, so that it has a capacity of but 504 cubic feet; consequently, if the door and window of this apartment were tightly closed throughout the night, the girl would be suffocated in not quite 4| hours' time. Muddle-headed Germans will, of course, sneer sceptically, in the profundity of their scientific ignorance, at such truths as these, though they themselves know that the majority of their people are obliged to sleep with their windows open ; and we ourselves have lived to see our young children rise from their beds, when the nights have been too cold to admit of un closed casements, with almost ulcerated eyelids, their bodies unrefreshed by their rest, and their cheeks pallid with the noi some vapours they had inhaled throughout the night. Even in our sitting-room it is impossible to allow a German to remain for upwards of an hour without throwing open the windows to purify the air. In all weathers — cold or wet — even though an easterly wind or damp fog prevail — the casements must be repeatedly set a-jar throughout the day, while the nights must be passed with gaping " fenstern,'J reckless of rheumatism or catarrhs ; for it is impossible to sleep with open doors instead, owing to the stench that steams up, like a nauseous miasma, from the waterless "Ablritte" on every landing of the staircase, the festering cesspools in the yard, and the barrels of rotting dust and garbage kept on every floor.

" No doubt it does offer some recommendations to those who are partial to east winds, and their concomitants, blue noses, rheumatism, and catarrhs. Why, sir, for six months of the year, taking a douche-bath in December is a luxury compared to turn ing a corner here, and plunging into a street running eastward. Afterwards follow a couple of months of in supportable heat, thunder, and lightning ; concluding with four months of rain, fog, sleet, snow, and hail, enlivened once or twice a-week throughout the year with hurricanes, which blow chimney-cans, glazed cupolas, and ladies with hooped petticoats, alike into the air." " But the streets and squares of the New Town are so very fine," I remarked. " Yes ; airy, steep, and equilateral, of all conscience, with the houses on one side reflecting those on the other with a precision that would delight the eye of Lord De Verd's gardener, who measures his carnation, tulip, and ranunculus beds with a tape-line, and encloses them with an edging of cast-iron, to prevent a stray bit of mould from falling to either side, and disturbing the symmetry of his figures." " The Old Town, then, I suppose, must be your fa vourite." " To be sure it is. Who could fail to be in love with those charming closes in the High Street and Canongate, where the inmates in the opposite houses, which tower eight or ten storeys high, can shake hands out of their room windows — closes where the sun never shines, where everything is stale, foul, and pestilential, and the air in the common-staircases is impregnated with a deadlier miasma than that of the Roman Campagna?

The darkest and most repulsive shade in a survey of human nature, is its proneness to transgress, and the consequent necessity of tribunals to decree the infliction of just retribution. This is an evil of the social compact, which is counterbalanced by a far greater amount of good that it secures to the orderly of civilized communities and nations. It preserves many of weak and wavering principles from the lists of malefactors, and enables the strong in right pur pose, to hold on their way of obligation in the unmo lested enjoyment of their rights.

Fathers of families, and grown up sons, often go into the Roman states, also ; this last year, many of the poor people never re turned, or returned emaciated with fever ; for malaria has prevailed more than usual in all the districts infected by it, in consequence of five months without rain, and the recent movement of the earth, in the Maremma, naturally awakens miasma.* Of nearly 4000 who go forth every * We have often succeeded in removing ague and fever in this country, with small doses of flour of sulphur, one third of an ounce in a glass of wine, every morning the fit is expected.

The sick men went into hospital, while their wives and children trusted to our skill, and in most cases, they were well long before those who were taking quinine in the regimental hospital. In England we gave the sul phur in a glass of beer. I have tried the specific in the Pontine marshes, where the guards at the frontier look dropping into the grave— the hue of death in their faces.

This conduct was, of course, the grave of all domestic peace, the destroyer of connubial love ; and by its dire, its demoniacal influences, caused the fairest island in the world to become, in a moral point of view, a dreary marsh, exhaling the poisonous miasma. Brighter days have, however, at length dawned ; the un hallowed custom of concubinage has greatly decreased ; and, indeed, except among some of the old white planters or mer chants, who have retained the sins of their youth, and some of the low coloured people, such alliances are generally reprobated. The assertion, however, that prejudice is entirely done away with, is incorrect. It still exists, and that, perhaps, very strongly ; but policy forbids, in great measure, its out ward show. It is true, that white and coloured gentlemen walk, and talk, and dine together — drink sangaree at one another's houses, sit in the same juror's box, and are invited, sans distinction, at " Government House ;" yet, at the same time, there is a lurking dislike to them on account of colour, which ever steps in as a barrier to social intercourse. It is said, that the white ladies are the strongest upholders of prejudice ; but that their refusal to mix with this class of persons is not occasioned from any shade of colour, but on account of their general illegitimacy. This, however, is not the sole cause ; for there are illegitimate white people, whom they are in the constant habit of meeting without any aver sion; while, at the same time, many of the people of colour, particularly the younger ones, are the offspring of parents who have been legally united within the sacred walls of the temple of God, and whose intellectual atiainments fit them for any society. It has also been said, that the coloured classes are not of a sufficient respectability to move among the white inhabitants; and some few years ago, the question was asked, (in excuse for excluding them from society,) by one who then filled the highest station in Antigua — " Would you wish to ask your

From the point where we first struck the low, sandy beach, although it must have been five miles distant, we could plainly see the churches, houses, and even the walls which environ Vera Cruz. The drive along the water's edge was slow and tedious, for the wheels of the diligence sank deep, and the sun, although but an hour risen from his cool bed in the gulf, was pouring down a flood of such heat as is only to be felt upon this unprotect ed sandy shore. While yet a mile intervened between us and the city, we could see innumerable sopilotes, or Mexican buzzards, standing moodily and solemnly upon the walls, housetops, and different towers and steeples, their eyes turned watchfully downward, on the look-out for their accustomed food. They are the scavengers of the city, and are never molested. On reaching the gate, around which a crowd of soldiers were lounging, a short detention sufficed with the officer stationed there to grant us permission to enter. A large conducta, or escort guarding nearly a million of dollars in silver, was entering the city at the same time. A drive of some fifteen minutes, through the wide and well-built streets, brought us to the principal hotel of the place, where we were soon safely housed. We were not long in learning that the much-dreaded black vomit was still raging in the city, although it had left the Woodbury. The stranger, as he looks through the comparatively clean and airy thoroughfares of Vera Cruz, and sees the wide waters of the Gulf of Mexico lying directly before him, is at a loss to account for the sickness which yearly carries to the grave its hundreds of victims. The low and damp region, through a part of which we hadkpassed in the morning, is the section whence come the noxious miasmas that generate the vomito The friends who had preceded us from Jala-

With the exception of a narrow line of sea-coast, we know little more of Africa now than Herodotus did two thousand three hundred years ago. Still it is the unknown land — a land of mystery and uncertainty — trod by savage men and savage beasts; and what with its torrid climate, pathless deserts, barbarous tribes, and fell miasma, it seems as inaccessible to the white man as ever. Whether it be godly zeal, or whether it be a mere esprit de corps, I cannot, tell ; but I cannot look on these wild mountains, and think on the wilder tribes beyond them, without feeling the spirit of the mis sionary arise. The most conspicuous of the mountains on the African coast is Mount Abyla, the other pillar of Hercules. It is commonly called Apes' Hill, being inhabited by a race of monkeys of the same spe cies as the monkeys of Gibraltar, and said to be found only in these tAvo places — thus confirming the old tradition of a submarine communication by St Michael's cave. This imaginary passage from Africa to Europe was, it seems, known to the Moors in former times; but is now only used by their suc cessors in knowledge, the monkeys. The two pil lars of Hercules bear a strong resemblance to each other in their animal, vegetable, and mineral produc tions ; many of which are to be found nowhere in Europe except on the rock of Gibraltar. This fact appears to confirm the opinion, that Gibraltar

Anothei1 Presbyterian gentleman, and a Scotchman, from the same cause, had gone to the Episcopalian minister. The yellow fever usually begins here every year about August and September; It is a very rapid fever, cutting off the sufferer in four days. One in ten of those attacked are said to die of it, taking the whole season, which, according td Dr S. Smith, is not greater than the proportion that die of typhus in the London hospitals; At the commencement of the season one in every three attacked are cut off, the fatality gradually diminishing towards the close of the season. Op» posite Mobile there lies a vast marsh, stretching nearly thirty miles. Towards autumn the wind blows from that quarter, and passing over the marsh, when vegetation is decaying, comes loaded with miasma. The sand of the soil in and around Mobile has been at one time plentifully mixed with oyster-shells, the deposite of the river and sea at some former time. It has been observed that so long as these oyster shells abounded and remained undecomposed, yellow fever seldom visited the city ; but that now the foul air of the marshes wants some such absorbent. How much truth there is in this connection I am not qualified to say; Such coin cidences in so important a matter are worthy of investigation. The old remedies for yellow fever were bleeding and purging ; but a French physician put my host into a hot-bath, as hot as he could bear, into which he poured two bottles of lime-juice, which brought instant relief, when the worst symptoms were appearing. A profuse perspiration was induced, and from that moment the recovery seemed begun. Ague is also very common, for which quinine is the principal remedy: I have some doubts, notwithstanding the terrors which the very name yellow fever carries, whether the mortality be actually arreater than in Great Britaini Public fears and actual statist

On a fine spring morning, when the window is opened, and the pure air is inhaled, unalloyed by any unseemly exhalation or prejudicial miasma, while the lark sweetly carols to the sky — the lovely beauteous dome spread over the fair scene of natural life by the Almighty Architect of the Universe — it must be a senseless clod of humanity indeed to behold the scene unmoved, and to cast the perceptions around without some fine thought, such as Cowper's, when he gratefully wrote — " My Father made them all ! " Passing along — with an occasional glance on either side — we come to the milestone. It is on the hedgeside of a pretty piece of greensward; and there it has stood faith fully, through storm and sunshine, through summer and winter, for many a year. It is an old friend to us ; for it was there in our boyish days, when that same bit of green sward won for a time the marked attention of the playmates let loose from the trammellings of school, in order to enjoy oh ! how deeply ! — the pure breathings of the fields and groves. We cared not for this money-getting world, for we had a pleasant world of our own — and there we revelled till hunger's demands led us home again.

But if it were not thus defended, all the Russian establishments on its northern bank would be eventually rooted out. Here the miasma arising from the marshy ground through which the river flows is so pestiferous, that thousands and thousands of any other troops than the Cossacs would perish in these insalubrious stations, and here the constitutional peculiarity of this strange people, which renders them insensible to climate, and causes them to thrive and multiply in the arctic regions of the Siberian Jakoutes, where the food is fish and train oil — on the shores of the Caspian, where the soil is a burning dust of salt and sand — as well as amidst the corn of the Ukraine or the vineyards of. the Don, — this natural hardihood in a great measure pro tects them against the unhealthiness of a spot which would prove fatal to all others. Next to the Tchornomorskie, the most formidable (from their numbers) are the Cossacs of the Don, in habiting the fertile banks of the river from which they take their name. Enticed from the Ukraine to the land they at present occupy, by the policy of the Empress Catherine, and on the strength of her pro mises of allowing them the full enjoyment of their ancient freedom, their constitution, which has always been perfectly democratic, had been religiously re spected until "the present reign. Nicholas, however, has made with success an attempt upon their valuable privileges, which it is likely he does not intend to confine to the Cossacs of the Don, though he has yet VOL. II. __.

In the Appendix to the Parliamentary Report, Vol. XII. 1842, there is a series of Rules and Maxims for the Preservation of the Health, for European travellers and residents in Africa, by Dr. Madden, which would perhaps be thought a fitting conclusion to the fore going remarks ; but as they contain several apparent contradictions, and have been the subject of some dissertation, we have thought it better to reserve them until some further conclusions can be arrived at on the subject. Every theory that has been broached hitherto has been, in a measure, abandoned, and the dire experience of the visitors to these noxious regions has rendered nugatory all regulations that have hitherto been laid down. Whether the effects of the climate are unconquerable and inevitable, still remains tobe proved; some maintain that it is not so, and that, with due precaution, a reasonable expectation may be formed that they may be overcome. The proposition that the production of sulphuretted hydrogen in the waters of the African Rivers, as mentioned in a former part of this work, is the cause of their unhealthiness, has been refuted, although it may add its share to the pestilential character of their malaria. Mr. Daniell, a medical gentleman, who has spent some years on the Gold Coast, &c, states, with full confidence, that Europeans can exist unharmed for any length of time in these parts, provided that proper attention is paid to the entirely altered nature of the condition and constitution. In this statement he is borne out by the fact of so many Europeans living scatheless and unattacked by the fever for many years on the coast of Africa, and having become completely acclimatized. We may revert to this subject on a future occasion.

The bays in the vaUey are stiU dotted over with the sites of the villages of those times, and with the ruined forts and tombs and mosques of theh Mahomedan rulers. Near the ancient site of Sajni, the chief town of one of these tracts, may be seen a banyan tree of im mense spread, whose trunk has embraced and hfted bodUy up from off the ground the domed masonry tomb, about twelve feet in all dimensions, of some Moslem notable, and so en veloped it with its thousand folds that not one stone of it is to be seen outside, while, passing inside by a narroAV opening, the arch of the dome and the waU wUl be seen to be almost perfect. A Moslem could scarcely deshe a fitter entombment than to be suspended thus between heaven and earth, like the prophet of his faith. It is now some seventy years since the malaria of the en croaching jungle and famine in the country caused by the fadure of the rains of heaven and the still more terrible strife of men desolated these settlements in the Tapti A'alley. The rank jungle then sprang on the deserted clearings, rendered fertde to weed as to cereal by the labour of man, and has now clothed them with a thicket of vegetation of such thickness, and guarded by a miasma so deadly, as to baffle aU attempts at renewed occupation by the Hindu cultivators densely crowded in the adjoining open country. Here and there the Korkus, whose constitutions seem impervious to malaria, have settled down on some neighbouring rising ground, and buUt a neat little village of Swiss-like cottages of bamboo, and have cleared and tilled the opener parts of the valley, raising such crops of wheat on the unexhausted black sod as are the enAry

These two facts are owing to the geographical position of the island, which is more southerly than that of Madeira, and to the relative position of Santa Cruz. We need, then, say no more on the subject of Santa Cruz or Puerto, whose reputation has long been established. We described the towns of Santa Cruz and Puerto at the beginning of this book; we must now describe Orotava, for we are about to treat of this little town as a medical station complemental to the other two. The town of Orotava is built on the slope of a hill stretching from east to west ; the incline from the moun tain to the sea is steep. Two cross streets are the only ones in which invalids can walk ; the rest are all but im practicable for them. The ground on which the town is built is exceedingly uneven, a hundred square yards of level ground are nowhere to be found except in the two horizontal streets, where the inclines are short and very gradual. The mountain springs flow into the town, but, from a hygienic point of view, they can have no bad effect, for they flow down covered channels. The large artificial reservoirs for collecting in winter the superfluous water which will be needed in the summer are built of stone or concrete, and there is no serious danger of deleterious miasmas arising from them. Few small towns are built in such a singular way as Orotava. The streets form, where they meet, the most unexpected angles ; they begin by being broad, become narrow, and end as they can. The lines of the buildings

The levante is followed by rain. In these Islands there is an alternate prevalence of land and sea winds, notwithstanding the general sameness of direction of the wind out at sea, beyond the influence of the capes, gulfs, and Cordilleras ; these local winds succeed each other at regular hours, and greatly contri- bute to the evenness of the temperature, the softness of the air, and the public health. In the daytime, under the influence of the sun, the wind comes from the sea, refreshes the atmosphere, and keeps up a moderate warmth ; between four and five the wind rises and blows from the land, carrying off to the sea the emanations from heated surfaces and the miasmas from the towns. In winter these winds are less regular than in summer. In short, throughout the year the Islands (with the exception of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, which are more African than the other five) enjoy a most delicious climate ; the trees never lose their leaves, nor the vege tation its vigour and verdure, nor the flowers their perfume. ' The climate which contributes the most to the growth and perfection of everything is that where no one thing predominates, where all are in perfect equilibrium.' This condition of the excellence of a country, pointed out by the ancients, is confirmed by modern experience. It is also one of the causes of the excellence of the flora. Too great a division of vegetable and animal species into genera and families produces a kind of monotony ; vege-

This affected us painfully, and we could not doubt their sincerity in refusing the coins we offered, until we assured them they were not for the flowers ! They became from that moment our friends, and run ning up the sides of the steep hills like antelopes, they would come on our paths in most unexpected places while we toiled along the mountain, and by the time we reached the gates of the city, our saddles and hats were filled with mountain-flowers. The natural grace of these poor children was marvellously beau tiful. Leaving Tivoli, we drove rapidly to Hadrian's villa. The ruins of this residence of the Emperor Hadrian are grand and imposing beyond description. It covered a space of ten miles in circuit, and after walking two hours through its groves and ruined temples, academies, theatres, libraries, baths, palaces, and slave-houses occupied by captives taken in battle, we were footsore and only half satisfied with the in spection. Here I realized the singular effect of the miasma around these Roman ruins. In the very act of walk ing, I was startled from a sound sleep by the voice of one of our party exclaiming, " Sister, she did not hear you, look ! she is asleep !

It is not the artist's province to preach, or even to teach, except by remote suggestion. Yet the mind of the artist may be highly moralised, and then he takes rank not merely with the ministers to refined pleasure, but also with the educators of the world. He may, for example, be penetrated with a just sense of humanity like Shakspere, or with a sublime temperance like Sophocles ; instinct with prophetic intuition like Michael Angelo, or with passionate ex perience like Beethoven. The mere sight of the work of Pheidias is like breathing pure health - giving air. Milton and Dahte were steeped in religious patriotism ; Goethe was pervaded with philosophy, and Balzac with scientific curiosity. Ariosto, Cervantes, and even Boccaccio are masters in the mysteries of common life. In all these cases the tone of the artist's mind is felt throughout his work : what he paints, or sings, or writes, conveys a lesson while it pleases. On the other hand, depravity in an artist or a poet percolates through work which has in it nothing positive of evil, and a very miasma of poisonous influence may rise from the apparently innocuous creations of a tainted soul. Now Correggio is moralised in neither way — neither as a good nor as a bad man, neither as an acute thinker nor as a deliberate voluptuary. He is simply sensuous. On his own ground he is even very fresh and healthy : his delineation of youthful maternity, for example, is as true as it is beautiful ; and his sympathy with the gleefulness of children is devoid of affectation. We have then only to ask ourselves whether the defect in him of all thought and feeling which is not at once capable of graceful fleshly incarnation, be sufficient to lower him in the scale

Deep down through the hollows of the Simplon a thunderstorm was driving; and we saw forked flashes once and again, as in a distant world, lighting up the valleys for a moment, and leaving the darkness blacker behind them as the storm blurred out the landscape forty miles away. Darkness was coming to us too, though our sky was clear and the stars were shining brightly. At our feet the earth was folding itself to sleep ; the plain was wholly lost ; little islands of white mist had formed themselves, and settled down upon the lakes and on their marshy estuaries ; the birds were hushed ; the gentian-cups were filling to the brim with dew. Night had descended on the mountain and the plain ; the show was over. The dawn was whitening in the east next morning, when we again scrambled through the dwarf beechwood to the precipice above the lake. Like an ink-blot it lay, unruffled, slumbering sadly. Broad sheets of vapour brooded on the plain, telling of miasma and fever, of which we on the mountain, in the pure cool air, knew nothing. The Alps were all there now — cold, unreal, stretching like a phantom line of snowy peaks, from the sharp pyramids of Monte Viso and the Grivola in the west to the distant Bernina and the Ortler in the east. Supreme among them towered Monte Rosa — queenly, triumphant, gazing down in proud pre eminence, as she does when seen from any point of the Italian plain. There is no mountain like her. Mont Blanc himself is scarcely so regal ; and she seems to know it, for even the clouds sweep humbled round her base, girdling her at most, but leaving her crown clear and free. Now, however, there were no clouds to be seen in all the sky. The mountains had
003478841	003478841_170	90 HOW I FOUND LIVINGSTONE. On the 8th we continued our journey, and arrived at Msuwa. This march will be remembered by our caravan as the most fatiguing of all, though the distance was but ten miles. It was one continuous jungle, except three interjacent glades of narrow limits, which gave us three breathing pauses in the dire task of jungle travelling. The odour emitted from its fell plants was so rank, so pungently acrid, and the miasma from its decayed vegeta tion so dense, that I expected every moment to see myself and men drop down in paroxysms of acute fever. Happily this evil was not added to that of loading and unloading the frequently falling packs. Seven soldiers to attend seventeen laden donkeys were entirely too small a number while passing through a jungle ; for while the path is but a foot wide, with a wall of thorny plants and creepers bristling on each side, and projecting branches darting across it, with knots of spikey twigs stiff as spike-nails, ready to catch and hold anything above four feet in height, it is but reasonable to suppose that donkeys standing four feet high, with loads measuring across from bale to bale four feet, would come to grief. This grief was of frequent recurrence here, causing us to pause every few minutes for re-arrangements. So often had this task to be performed, that the men got perfectly discouraged, and had to be spoken to sharply before they set to work. By the time I reached Msuwa there was nobody with me and the ten donkeys I drove but Mabruk the Little, who, though generally stolid, stood to his work like a man. Bombay and Uledi were far behind, with the most jaded donkeys. Shaw was in charge of the cart, and his experiences were most bitter, as he informed me he had expended a whole vocabulary of stormy abuse known to sailors, and a new one which he

It was therefore fortunate for me that I overtook him at Kiora ; though he was about to prove a sore incum brance to me, for he was not able to walk, and the donkey carriage, after the rough experience of the Makata valley, was failing. I could not possibly leave him at Kiora, death would soon overtake him there ; but how long I could convey a man in such a state, through a country devoid of carriage, was a question to be resolved by circumstances. On the 11th of May, the third a»d fifth caravans, now united, followed up the right bank of the Mukondokwa, through fields of holcus, the great Mukondokwa ranges rising in higher altitude as we proceeded west, and en folding us in the narrow river valley round about. We left Muniyi Usagara on our right, and soon after found hill-spurs athwart our road, which we were obliged to ascend and descend. A march of eight miles from the ford of Misonghi brought us to another ford of the Mukondokwa, where we bid a long adieu to Burton's road, which led up to the Goma pass and up the steep slopes of Rubeho. Our road left the right bank and followed the left over a country quite the reverse of the Mukondokwa Valley, enclosed between mountain ranges. Fertile soils and spontaneous vegetation, reeking with miasma and over powering from their odour, we had exchanged for a drouthy wilderness of aloetic and cactaceous plants, where the kolquall and several thorn bushes grew paramount. . Instead of the tree-clad heights, slopes and valleys, instead of cultivated fields, we saw now the confines of

The scene six days after the event — when the river has subsided into its normal breadth and depth during the monsoons — is simply awful. Wherever we look, we find something very suggestive of the devastation that has visited the country ; fields of corn are covered with many feet of sand and debris ; Ihe sandy bed the river has deserted is about a mile wide ; and there are but three villages standing of all that I noticed when en route to Unyanyembe. When I asked Mussoudi where the people had gone to, he replied, " God has taken most of them, but some have gone to Udoe." The surest blow ever struck at the tribe of the Wakami was indeed given by tbe hand of God ; and, to use the words of the Diwan, " God's power is wonderful, and who can resist Him !" I again resort to my Diary, and extract the following : April 30th. — Passing Msuwa, we travelled hurriedly through the jungle which saw such hard work with us when going to Unyanyembe. What dreadful odors and indescribable loathing this jungle produces ! It is so dense that a tiger could not crawl through it ; it is so impenetrable that an elephant could not force his way ! Were a bottleful of concentrated miasma, such as we inhale herein, collected, what a deadly poison, instantaneous in its action, undiscoverable in its properties, would it be ! I think it would act quicker than chloroform, be as fatal as prussic acid. Horrors upon horrors are in it. Boas above our heads, snakes and scorpions under our feet. Land-crabs, terra pins, and iguanas move about in our vicinity. Malaria is in the air we breathe ; the road is infested with " hot water " ants, which bite our legs until we dance and

Yet here, in verity, are the ten plagues of Egypt, through which a traveller in these regions must run the gauntlet 1. Plague of boas. 7. Suffocation from the density 2.

Kingaru Hera. — We heard news of a great storm having raged at Zanzibar, which has destroyed every house and every ship, — so the story runs ; — and the same destruction has visited Bagamoyo and Wbinde, they say. But I am by this. time pretty well acquainted with the exaggerative tendency of the African. It is possible that serious loss has been sustained, from the evidences of the effects of the storm in the interior. I hear, also, that there are white men at Bagamoyo, who are about starting into the country to look after me (?). Who would look after me, I cannot imagine. I think they must have some confused idea of my Expedition ; though, how they came to know that I was looking for any man I- cannot conceive, because I never told a soul until I reached Unyanyembe. May '2nd. Rosako. — I had barely arrived at tbe village before the three men I despatched from Mvumi, Ugogo, entered, bringing with them from the generous American Consul a few bottles of champagne, a few pots of jam, and two boxes of Boston crackers. These were most welcome after my terrible experiences in the Makata Valley. In side one of these boxes, carefully put up by the Consul,

And, notwithstanding, no monument can express nothingness so wed as this paradelogram, irregular, solemn, and death-like. We ad require an obscure dwelhng under our feet, which awaits the moment of our death like the desert the raindrops. We all have a sepulchre. The nakedness of the exterior of the Campo Santo of Pisa, the monotony, the uni formity — -are the nakedness, the monotony, the uni formity of death. As the gate opens, you fancy it is the gate of Eternity. The cold of those vaults petrifies your bones ; the sdence of those graves de prives you of utterance. I felt completely isolated, hke a dead man forgotten in his coffin. I, wandering without home, without country, asked myself if that journey was not the symbol of my last voyage, if that passing visit to the cemetery was not the anticipated picture of the day in which men should come to fetch my body and throw it into a pit that its putrid miasma should not infect the air they breathe. The guardian of the dead, who was standing near the gate, invited me to enter. The most melancholy ideas struggled in my brain, and fell like corrosive drops upon my heart. The sound of a pickaxe digging the hollow graves, and the jing ling of the keys carried by the guardian, fell painfully on my ear. But, nevertheless, I entered, thinking that death is after all as natural as life, that the

Add asphyxia from the miasma, burial by the earth falling in, sudden set tlings of the bottom, and the work of constructing sewers can well be understood to be dangerous." In all that he has written, Victor Hugo has produced noth ing more graphic than his description of Jean Valjean in the sewers of Paris, when endeavoring to escape from the police, after the fight at the barricades. We quote his description, omitting a few paragraphs. " It was in the sewer of Paris that Jean Valjean found himself. " A resemblance of Paris with the sea. As in the ocean, the diver can disappear. " The transition was marvellous. From the very centre of the city, Jean Valjean had gone out of the city, and, in ihe twinkling of an eye, the time of lifting a cover and closing it again, he had passed from broad day to complete obscurity, from noon to midnight, from uproar to silence, from the whirl of the thunder to the stagnation of the tomb, and, by a muta tion much more prodigious still than that of the Rue Polon ceau, from the most extreme peril to the most absolute, security. "Sudden fall into a cave; disappearance in the dungeon of Paris ; to leave that street in which death was everywhere for this kind of sepulchre, in which there was life, was an astounding crisis. He remained for some seconds as if stunned ; listening, stupefied. The spring trap of safety had suddenly opened beneath him. Celestial goodness had in some sort ta ken him by treachery. Adorable ambuscades of Providence ! " Only, the wounded man did not stir, and Jean Valjean did not know whether what he was carrying away in this grave were alive or dead. "His first sensation was blindness. Suddenly he saw noth ing more. It seemed to him also that in one minute he became deaf. He heard nothing more. The frenzied storm of murder which was raging a few feet above him only reached him, as we have said, thanks to the thickness of the
001992757	001992757_491	539 LIGHT AND DARKNESS. earth which separated him from it, stifled and indistinct, and like a rumbling at a great depth. He felt that it was solid under his feet; that was all; but that was enough. He reached out one hand, then the other, and touched the wall on both sides, and realized that the passage was narrow; he slipped, and realized that the pavement was wet. He ad vanced one foot with precaution, fearing a hole, a pit, some gulf; he made sure that the flagging continued. A whiff of fetidness informed him where he was. "After a few moments he ceased to be blind. A little light fell from the air-hole through which he had slipped in, and his eye became accustomed to this cave. He began to dis tinguish something. The passage in which he was earthed — no other word better expresses the condition — was walled up behind him. It was one of those cul-de-sacs technically called branchments. Before him there was another wall, a wall of night. The light from the air-hole died out ten or twelve paces from the point at which Jean Valjean stood, and scarcely produced a pallid whiteness over a few yards of the damp wall of the sewer. Beyond, the opaqueness was mas sive ; to penetrate it appeared horrible, and to enter it seemed like being ingulfed. He could, however, force his way into that wall of mist, and he must do it. He must even hasten. Jean Valjean thought that that grating, noticed by him under the paving-stones, might also be noticed by the soldiers, and that all depended upon that chance. They also could descend into the well and explore it. There was not a minute to be lost. He had laid Marius upon the ground ; he gathered him up, — this is again the right word, — replaced him upon his shoulders, and began his journey. He resolutely entered that obscurity. " The truth is, that they were not so safe as Jean Valjean supposed. Perils of another kind, and not less great, awaited them perhaps. After the flashing whirl of the combat, the caveru of miasmas and pitfalls ; after chaos, the cloaca. Jean Valjean had fallen from one circle of hell to another. " At the end of fifty paces he was obliged to stop. A ques-
003307403	003307403_290	PROJECT OF SECOND NIAMNIAM TOUR. 271 Niam-niam, which I had just quitted. I could not be other wise than conscious that I had taken a step which brought me nearer Europe. The large establishment with its diver sified population of full many a hue, the mere sight of clothes and linen that had known what it is to be washed, the unaccustomed diversity of victuals of which we could partake, all seemed so different to the contracted resources and. meagre fare to which of late I had been subject, that I could hardly resist the impression that I must be living in a city, and could almost fancy myself already back at Khartoom. But before that could happen there were many obstacles to be overcome, and I must submit for various reasons to stay where I was. The journey to the Meshera, at this season of the year, presented nothing but countless marshes, the very birthplace of the miasma, which in its turn begets fever. Fresh deprivations for months to come would be the penalty of attempting at once to proceed up the river, and I had, moreover, reason to mistrust the capa bility of my constitution to. withstand disease if I put it to too stern a test. I resolved, therefore, to tarry as patiently as I could, and to console myself with the pleasure of antici pation. In addition to this I had several important tasks which had never been satisfactorily finished, although I felt that the main object of my mission had been generally accomplished. The temptation to a second Niam-niam tour was too strong to be resisted. I felt that it was my business to strike while the iron was hot, because future travellers only too probably would find that opportunities so good as my own were closed against them. Exactly a month after our arrival a party was despatched for the purpose of fetching the supplies which were on their way to me. Not only my own effects, but Ghattas's too, were all lying crammed up in the meagre and not over-safe accommodation of the hold of the boats.
003307403	003307403_297	THE HEART OF AFRICA. 278 from a hose, all over its body to wash off the dust of the road and the mud that it had contracted in crossing the swamps. For my own amusement I had made a collection of several other animals, which I lodged in my hut, in order to have them under constant supervision and to be able to observe their habits. My menagerie contributed very much to the characteristic features of my hut. Outside were tethered my donkey and my cow ; but the calf, being too delicate to with stand the rain, was brought in at nights, and fastened to the tall scaffolding which supported my bed, the noxious miasma during the rainy period making it desirable for every traveller to spend his hours of sleep raised as much as possible above the level of the ground. Different corners of the hut, which was already encumbered with every variety of furniture, were appropriated to my dogs, two caracal lynxes, a ratel, or honey-badger, and a zebra-ichneumon. These creatures lived in continual feud, and did not show the least likelihood of becoming "a happy family." The honey badger and the ichneumon were perhaps the most amicable, but even they were continually snapping at each other; still they never came into any mortal conflict. But the caracals were utterly implacable, and fought most savagely : in spite, however, of their general faculty of self-defence, one of them in a desperate encounter with a Bongo dog was bitten in the throat and died on the spot. I had brought a large number of lances and of bows and arrows from the Monbuttoo, and felt inclined not only to try the efficiency of the weapons, but to test the marksmanship of the representatives of the vai*ious tribes that were in cluded iii the promiscuous population of the Seriba. Accord ingly more than once I set up one of the Monbuttoo shields as a target, and instituted a general shooting-match. Tikki tikki was an eminently successful shot, the grotesque atti tudes into which he threw* himself to exhibit his dexterity

Certain it was that the swarms of rats that had infested the huts and undermined the soil had been all but exterminated by the fire ; the crowds of red-headed lizards (Agamas) that u.ed to frisk up and down the old rotten palisade were no longer to be seen ; the horned beetles (Scarabæus nasicornus) and their grubs that had once covered every dung-heap were totally annihilated; it was man alone who was unchanged, and the same revolting forms, infected with syphilis, scab., and boils were spreading their putrid miasma around. Tottering along betwixt the crooked, tumble down straw hedges and amidst the heaps of garbage and of refuse might still be seen the wretched fever-stricken beings, with shorn heads covered with scabs and every limb a mass of festering matter ; everywhere prevailed the moaning and groaning of a lingering death ; the people were not so much what they were accustomed to call themselves and each other in their curses, " dogs and the sons of dogs," they were rather sons of dirt, born and bred in an atmo sphere of abscess and corruption. I found my former garden ragged and barren as a wilder ness ; the only surviving memorials of what it had been were the tomatoes flourishing persistently upon the fertile soil, and the sunflowers that gloried in the tropical sun. Some of the sunflowers rose in great pyramids of foliage to a height of over ten feet, aud with their huge disks of blossoms ever turned towards the full glare of light, presented an appearance that was very striking. In this strange world their splendour could not but irresistibly attract me, and I often sat down on the ground before them, aud while gazing on their brightness recalled the fading memories of the past and conjured up anew the recollections of my distant travels, looking back upon the scenes I had passed, as a traveller looking through the back window of his carriage might take a retrospect of the country he had left behind.

Oranges, bananas, palms, custard apples, limes, pineapples, are indigenous; the sugar cane and tobacco would flou rish; even European products — lettuces, radishes, &c. — are grown with great success by some of the English merchants in their gardens; and yet the jungle extends, almost untouched by the hand of man, right up to the town. It cannot be doubted that the clearance of this rank vegetation and the substitution for it of cultivated crops would greatly decrease the miasma in the wet season, and would proportionately improve the health of the town. Wonderfully noisy are the natives ; they chatter, and laugh, and yell in a marvellous manner, and no thought of approaching Ashantis troubles them in the slightest. The children, who absolutely swarm there, contribute even more than their share to the general tumult. I never saw such children to cry. They appeared to have an immense objection to water, and howled the whole time they were being washed. Whether their mothers take a delight in the strength of their offsprings' lungs, or whatever be the cause, I know not; but they never seem to endeavour to put a stop to these yells, or by timely castigation give the child ren something really to cry for. The people are cleanly in their personal habits, and washing is a daily practice. Consequently, the chorus of juvenile howls from six to nine is absolutely deafening. But it is not only at washing hours that one's ears are deafened by juvenile wailings. The youthful negro's tears are called up by the very slightest cause, and he has

Not less anxious were officers kept back to get to the front. Some volunteered to act as sergeant-majors with Wood's and Russell's regi ments; while some of the doctors, of whom we had now a legion, volunteered to act as transport officers. The first wing of the Rifle Brigade marched in on the morning of the 17th. The sailors turned out and gave them three heart}' cheers, which were as heartily responded to. The men were looking well and hearty, but not so well as when they entered Barracoo a week before. The week of delay was certainly to be much regretted in respect to the health of the troops. Had they marched, as was originally intended, without a halt, except to con centrate here, from Cape Coast to Coomassie, I believe that they would have suffered much less from illness than they did. Troops upon the march are almost invariably healthy. The constant change of scene and air, the steady exercise, and, above all, the excitement, keep men up ; and although in the present case they could hardly hope to escape without getting some of the malaria poison in them, it would probably not have shown itself before their work was over, and they were steaming homewards, where the colder climate would soon overpower the effects of the tropical miasma. It could hardly be hoped that they would escape scot-free after this halt. There were already signs that the men's health was not, as a whole, so good as it was. The weather, too, was very hot. I found it very much more oppressive than Cape Coast; but upon that point opinions were divided. The thermometer stood at eighty-nine in the huts, five or six degrees higher in the

On Monday, 8th September, the execution took place. While upon the scaffold, William Holden said to the multitude, " I am now going to meet my God, and in the face of Him I declare I am as innocent of the concern as the child yet unborn." David Ashcroft said, " You are all assembled to see four innocent men suffer. ... I would not now tell a lie for all the world." As soon as the elder Ashcroft came upon the scaffold, he kissed his son. After the ropes were affixed, they all sang a hymn which David gave out. It was the well-known hymn beginning — I'll praise my Maker whilst I've breath, And when my voice is lost in death, Praise shall employ my nobler powers My hours of praise shall ne'er be past, While life, and thought, and being last, Or immortality endures." While they were singing, the drop fell, and the guilt or innocence of the four men remains to the present day a debatable point — a problem unsolved. The inscriptions in the Cathedral Yard are essentially prosaic : few verses are visible. Perhaps the surround ings are anti-poetical. The springs of Castalia, we may remember, were not polluted, as are the streams of the Irwell and the Irk. Neither was the atmosphere breathed at Mount Helicon tainted, as with us, by chemical miasma. In our city churchyard Gray could never have composed his famous Elegy. As we wander into the country, we become impressed with the fancy — almost

It is certain that either country could have raised armies stronger, both in numbers and in spirit, for defensive than for offensive war. The President could have expected no " different use of victory," because he ' knew that I thought that the next important service of that army would be near the end of October, against the invasion of a much greater Federal army than McDowell's ; and he proposed, the day after the battle, to send me, with a part of the army at Manassas, to Western Virginia. Our own dead Avere buried without unnecessary delay ; but the expectation on our part that General McDowell would send a party of his own soldiers to perform that duty to their late comrades, left the Federal dead unburied several days, until we found it necessary to inter them. After the troops had been somewhat reorganized, new positions were assigned to them. Among the charges against me, is that of exposing the army at the same time to the stench of the battle-field,1 and the miasma of the August heat, and thus producing " camp-fevers tenfold more fatal than the bullets of the enemy." Those who have seen large bodies of new troops know that they are sickly in all climates. Our South ern volunteers were peculiarly so, being attacked in the early part of their camp-life by measles and 1 See page 36. a DabDey's " Life of Jackson," p. 234. 5

The turf loving residents look forward to the race-meeting from year to year as the crowning pleasure of the whole twelvemonth, making up to them for all the heat and hardships of a place which has been termed the grave of Europeans. Although, strangely enough, but a step divides the living from the dead in this truly picturesque valley, the island itself is accounted one of the healthiest stations on the coast of China. The present style of living has probably something to do with the improved health of the community. The houses are better adapted to the climate than they were some twenty years back. The sanitary arrange ments are also more complete ; whereas, when first the city was being built, vast surfaces of decomposed granite were laid bare as the workmen cut into the face of the hill ; from the exposed spots noxious miasmas were exhaled, and to them are attributed those maladies which prevailed so fatally at that time, and which proved themselves the worst enemies our troops had to contend against in China. Even now, whenever the soil has to be opened anew, we still hear cases of this Hongkong fever occurring near the spot. The Chinese geomancers attributed the prevalence of this disease to our ignorance of the laws of ' Feng Shui ' — literally ' wind and water,' but denoting something like good luck brought about by a knowledge of astrology and geomancy — and it must be acknowledged that they correctly foretold the results which befel the colony as soon as the hill-sides were opened.

The review being over, we joined the invited guests, and partook of refreshments at the General's residence. A happy combination of circumstances rendered the six weeks of my sojourn at Fort McHenry a delightful recreation. It was in the lovely months of May and June, when the rural scenery of Maryland presents its most enchanting view. The season when the over worked denizens of large and crowded towns should bid adieu, for a time, to the heat, smoke and unhealthy miasma of a city atmosphere, and hie to the country. Fort McHenry is about a mile from the suburbs of Baltimore, and being situated in a somewhat triangular neck of land (a peninsula), with one of its sides washed by the river Patapsco, and the other by the basin or harbor of Baltimore, it affords a very agreeable, quiet country-like retreat, where the exhausted and weary student, or professional man, can inhale the invigorat ing sea and country air, and enjoy a comparative free dom from the cares of busy life. I did not, however, lead the life of a sluggard. My professional duties were promptly attended to, and the most of my leisure hours devoted to mental culture. Still the stream of my life had begun to run in a chan nel so quiet and smooth, in comparison to the never ceasing toil of my student life, that I began to think, after all, the lot of an army medical officer was quite as good as a young man with moderate aspirations could desire.

Fine grass, potatoes, cab bage, and a few similar products can be raised there; but most of the ordinary vegetables, fruits and cereals do not thrive well, because of the coolness of the sum mers and moisture of the atmosphere. The climate is remarkably uniform, there being but little difference between the seasons. Having said a good deal about this district in my journal, I shall add but little here. Its uniform cli mate, invigorating sea air, and freedom from miasma, render it the most healthful part of Oregon. It is the fashionable summer resort of persons living in the Wil lamette Valley, particularly of the citizens of Portland.

Although the Coast Dis trict is in itself very narrow, yet there are numerous fer tile valleys leading into the mountains along the streams that run across the coast belt into the Pacific Ocean. The soil and climate in these little valleys render them better adapted for agricultural purposes than the land immediately along the coast. Yet the numerous cosy little prairies found in the valleys afford greater advan tages for the dairy business than for any other pur suit. The sands of the sea shore almost glitter with gold dust. The mountain spurs, jutting out close to the ocean, are filled with copper, iron and coal. The hills and valleys are covered with the finest fir and ce dar for lumber to be found anywhere in the United States. The inlets and bays abound in oysters and salmon, and the mountain streams with speckled trout.

The delta contains some parts of rich silt, and the im mediate margins of the river are generally covered with a light loam, but for the most part the soil is naturally poor, and it is irrigation alone which makes the province such a scene of fertility. The varieties of soil in the higher grounds beyond the delta are red loam, black cotton soil, sandy light earth, and yellow clay, much impregnated with soda and miserably sterile. In the Puttacottah Taluk soda is collected from such soil for the manufacture of soap. The climate of Tanjore is much the same as that of the maritime Carnatic in Climate. general. It is a remarkable fact that in these tropical provinces covered with water, as it is during half the year, miasma is wholly unknown. The provincial sanitarium is point Caly mere, which may be said to enjoy a perpetual sea breeze and is a pleasant retreat for Europeans from the heated land winds. The agricultural staple of the province is chiefly paddy. You will also find sugar cane plantations, gardens of Staple products. plantain fruit, tobacco, indigo, the Noonah or Morun-

Students from those seats of learning might be sent to London, Paris, or Edinburgh, to obtain European diplomas, and, when duly qualified, stationed along the whole route through El Hejaz. Dispensers of medi cine, with their attendants, and gravediggers, over all of whom a Hakim Bachi should have the necessary command, might Hkewise be appointed. Thus we might at last hope to see the time when Egypt would no longer be the fatal source whence springs that scourge of the human race, the cholera, that spreads its pestilential vapours over all lands. The dead might be properly interred also — no longer buried, as is now the case, in fatal haste in shallow desert sand which shifts and flies away under the first moderate blast of wind, leaving the corpses all exposed to view, and infecting the whole atmosphere for mUes around, with their foid and pestilential stench. Deep trenches might Hkewise be dug in every place where sacrifices of sheep are offered up to Allah, who would surely permit their skin, bone, and entrails being buried in the sand. Plans like these, if they are firmly carried out, might prevent the deadly and contagious miasma now arising from the exhalations engendered by ac cumulations of fetid matter, doubly empoisoned by the burning atmosphere, and which is wafted even to Europe. " So intense had been the heat during the whole of the journey," said the Mohaddetyn, now resumino- the course of his narrative, " that I was not at aU surprised at seeing, just as we were on the point of resuming

Personally, I cannot speak of this wet season, having had nothing more than occa sional April showers during my stay in Algiers from December to April — but then that was considered an exception. On most days one could dress as in June at home. The mean winter temperature of Algiers is 53°. The mean summer temperature is 75°.* Formerly marsh-fever was the scourge of the Metidja, but owing to effective drainage and planting, some villages have been rendered quite healthy, and there are few where, with proper precautions, the miasma may not be guarded against. This subject concerns colonists more than tourists, who naturally take up their abode in or near the city, for many reasons. * I abstract with permission the following table of the mean temperature of Algiers, from a little work published in Algiers some years since : — Fahrenheit. 1850 8 a.m. Noon 5 p.m. Mean Temperature of first 15 days December 5943 61-20 6066 ,, of last 16 „ „ 53 40 5522 5416 1857 of first 15 days January, 5286 55 27 54-17 of last 16 ,, „ 49-25 51-52 42-66 ,, of first 14 days February, 51-64 5527 5458 of last 14 „ „ 5904 61-37 6002 of first 15 days March, 56-30 59-12 51-87 „ of last 16 „ „ 59-66 0289 00-90
000610610	000610610_70	FORT GARRY TO FORT ELLICE. 42 CHAP. IV. Sunday, June 19th.— Aster a talk with M'Kay, I settled to have a complete halt on Sundays. [I made this rule from no strict Sabbatarian reasons, but from a belief that the special weekly holiday would be good for man and beast ; a reminder of home ties for the former, and a useful rest for both. The Scottish settlers seldom shoot on Sundays, but their travelling goes on without difference, so my rule was rather a novelty. These breaks in the journey answered well enough in summer, but had to be given up when cold weather set in. Delay then becomes too dangerous. Thirty below zero is a great stimidator, especially when food runs short, and supplies are few and far between. The camp was very unwholesomely placed within a dozen yards of a large mosquito-haunted marsh, whence the boom of the bittern resounded at intervals, like the distant roaring of a bull. My hardy men never thought of such things as damp and miasma, nor, to tell the truth, did I, yet probably many a troublesome symptom arose from camping in such swampy places, though our healthy active habits saved us from serious illness. At this camp I passed two wretched nights, unwell with out suspecting the cause, but moving on Monday to higher ground the change at once cured me. Perhaps some hours in the swamp, wading knee-deep after ducks and bitterns, had done me more mischief than I knew of.] Whde here I received a visit from Mr. Simpson and his half-brother, who were on their way to Fort Garry. They stayed an hour or two, and had dinner in my tent. The former had come straight from Fort Pitt, on the Saskatchewan, where, till lately, he had been the officer in charge. He brought the unwelcome news that the Crees and Blackfeet were at the point of going to war. This, it was evident, would

Shall we give less glory to the God of Israel, because, when " the Assyrians came down like a wolf on the fold," instead of discovering the angel of the Lord actually going, sword in hand, through the camp of the enemies of Jerusalem, and smiting a hundred and fourscore and five thousand,* we detect only the pestilential miasma of the Egyp tian marshes, or the noxious, hot breath of the desert ?f Was the deliverance of Israel less wonderful, if thus delivered? Was it less divine? Not if there be a Providence, as well as a miracle-working God. Again : Is that a wisely reverential literalism which so repeats the language of the narrative respecting the plague wrought upon the waters of Egypt for the deliverance of Israel as constantly to invite the charge, so impa tiently urged, of intrinsic improbability? To so inter pret, or misinterpret, the sacred writer, as to charge him with representing the Nile as actually turning to the element of blood, is not a less absurd literalism than that which contorts the words of Scripture into support of the doctrine of transubstantiation.J * Isa. xxxvii. 36. t Hebrew scholars inform us that the expression " Angel of Jehovah" is a Hebraism, meaning often any physical cause of destruction, as the plague, a storm, or a pestilential fever. Vaux supposes the agent which destroyed the Assyrian army to be a pestilential " blast" from the des ert. Dr. Smith says : " The secondary agency is usually supposed to be a pestilence, caused (if the event occurred at or near Pelusium) by the malaria of the delta marshes." — "Ancient History of the East," p. 395.

Voyagers, driven into obscure regions by untoward winds, may have passed a low peninsula jutting out from one of the islands of the Eastern Archipelago. Twenty years ago the3r would have admired the luxuriant beauty of the vegetation, and the many lovely nooks created by the entrance of the sea, forgetting that in its depths hovered the voracious shark, and unaware that ashore they would have found this seeming paradise, apparently so green, so cool, and yet so gaudy with lovely hues, to be teeming with snakes, and rank with miasma. The island itself was not a large one, but was peculiarly formed. On the eastern side, it sloped gradually down from a high ridge, and the slopes were covered with jungle, which had, however, iii many places yielded to the slight labour necessary for cultivation in that favoured region. Springs towards the loftier parts of the range were the parents of innumerable little streams, whicli here and there sparkled and glanced in the sun, as they wandered on their way, through forest and open country, to the sea. And the shady' nooks and tiny waterfalls were seldom without an occupant, in the shape of a native enjoying that greatest luxury of all in a hot climate — fresh, clear, and cold water. The banana, the plantain, the cocoa-nut, the pine-apple, and every rich and luscious fruit known to the clime,

Several large tanks, in a state of fair preservation, with two fine old Hindoo temples still remain to testify to the energy and civilization formerly characteristic of the Assamese, which form a striking contrast to the lethargic existence of the present scanty population. The contemplation of these ruins, surrounded by an almost impracticable jungle, which has over-grown the once fertile and well-cultivated fields of a people that have almost passed away, is calculated to strike one with an intense desire to learn more of the history of those terrible events, which have robbed a fertile country of a large and industrious population, and converted it into a wilderness of swampy forest, breeding deadly miasma, and teeming with wild beasts and reptiles. The mouth of the Dikhoo river has obtained an unen viable notoriety from the swarms of insatiable mosquitoes which attack man and beast most viciously. I have suffered from the attack of mosquitoes in several countries, especially on the banks of the Irra waddy in Burmah ; but the Dikhoo mosquito is the most venomous that I ever encountered. Their envenomed attacks soon drove all from the usual evening lounge on deck, to seek refuge in bed under the mosquito curtains ; but in less than an hour every one was on deck again in a state of absolute torment, and sleep was out of the question.

But all have perished : the canals have been dammed up, and vast swamps formed along their banks. Pernicious miasmas are exhaled during the summer heat ; fever devastates the neigh bouring populations. In 1841, a village in the neighbour hood of Cordova lost, it is said, all its inhabitants except one, through an epidemic. So this noble country, despite its river, and its mountains, with their graceful outlines, despite the smiling verdure which clothes it in the spring, presents to the eye a somewhat mono tonous aspect. Great plains, covered with corn and herbage ; few or no trees, except the olives on the hills, and some rare mulberry plantations ; here and there, at great distances, a little town ; some scanty villages, or a few isolated farms. One feels that the country is in want of a population. Spain, with a superficies nearly equal to that of France, has only fifteen millions of inhabitants, while it could easily support three or four times as many. And observe that the Guadalquivir valley is one of the best cultivated districts in Andalusia. The country situated between Medina-Sidonia and Gibraltar, a country not less fertile, appears to be still more sparsely peopled ; you may travel ten leagues, and not meet with an inhabitant ; you see only ruined houses and broken-down bridges. This impoverishment, this depopulation, this decadence of a country formerly so rich and powerful, is a spectacle which everywhere grieves and saddens the traveller in Spain ; but nowhere is its effect more painful than in Andalusia, because nowhere else has Nature done so much for man. Man seems to have found a pleasure in allowing the gifts of Nature to

On its north shore is a pebbly and muddy beach without shell or trace of living creature, so far as I observed ; no vegetation surrounds it, and for our usual noonday lunch we could obtain no shade from the sun : I had to use my umbrella, and can now better understand Jonah's complaint over his withered Gourd, and the beauty of the prophet's figure — " The shadow of a great rock in a weary land ! " On its banks are a number of reeds, but they were perfectly withered and dry, probably irri gated hoAvever by some stray streams from the Jordan at the period of its annual inundation. Altogether the scene was the wildest and most death-like of any I have ever seen, and had an extremely depressing effect on the spirits, for which no doubt an unwonted atmosphere was also to blame. So intense was the heat at this level, the loAvest spot on the earth's surface — being 1300 feet under the level of the Mediterranean Sea, and more than 3000 under that of Jerusalem — that three of our party who had made a tour of the world said they had never experienced heat so intolerable, not even under the equator, nor yet on the Red Sea voyage. Some say a miasma rises from the slime beds of the Dead Sea which induces this depression of spirits and excessive fatigue This is possible, but probably imagina tion has something to do with the feehng. True it is, however, that neither man nor liAdng thing tarries many hours in its vicinity; nor is boat seen on its silent solitary Avaters, although from their high specific gravity every- I

The streets are irregular, narrow, and badly drained ; and thus in the rainy season great pools of stagnant water throw off their deadly miasma, generating the fevers that are still prevalent, but are yearly becoming less frequent. Certainly outside of the city, or on the opposite bank of the river, in the desert, I believe it to be perfectly healthy. The European population is composed principally of Greek, and a few Italian merchants, chiefly engaged in the sale of wines, raki, beer, canned fruits, meats, and vegetables ; the Arab, Turk, and Copt controlling till of late years, the Dongolowee element, that are recruited here as irregular soldiers, or ivory hunters for the interior of Africa, by the ivory merchants, who arm, equip, and furnish them with the necessary " suc-suc " (beads) and other trumpery, for which ivory is exchanged by the savage. A palace and several well-built government buildings face the river-side, where a well-built quay with stone staircase gives easy descent to the steamers that lie alongside. His Excellency the Governor General received us with marked attention : troops were paraded, and a salvo of guns announced our arrival. The European colony came to present their respects, represented by the Consul General of Austria, the Superintendent of the Soudan Telegraph, and the Apostolic Vicar of the Austrian Catholic Mis-

Sleep ing upon the ground in regions infested with miasma, subsisting on food that would have de stroyed the digestion of a coyote, he fell an easy prey to camp diseases with the first rains. Many, with becoming energy and forethought, provided shelter for themselves by building canvas or log cabins, but the greater number became dependent for shelter and sustenance at the cost of all they had to offer. Memory draws a veil over the harrowing scenes of that memorable Winter, but through its tattered folds are revealed glimpses of misery more than enough; faces pale and haggard with wasting dis ease; faces calm with the courage of despair; tears of beardless youth, overcome by- home sickness and longing to return to their father's house, where they knew the fatted calf would welcome them back; the strong man dying, where no kind hand of woman administered to his wants, calling in muttered delirium upon the name of loved ones, who listened long and vainly for his returning footsteps; of heartless selfishness and the noblest charity; ofthe pietist turned fiend, and the outlaw transfigured to a saint; we wake from the reverie as from a troubled dream. As we revisit the scenes of those sorrowful reminiscences, we wonder if they can be the same !

It was a novel sight to see the embarkation of these returning adven turers, with their monkeys, parrots, macaws, blank ets, and bags containing six days' provisions, etc. The scene upon that shore was one not easily for gotten. We whiled away the time wandering along the shores and about the suburbs of the town. The natives are everywhere very kind, and saluted us as we passed with such English as they had acquired from their more civilized guests, and even the little ones would say, smiling with genu ine good feeling, " Good-by — go to h — —II !" A lad of twelve or fourteen years asked me for a cigar, which I gave him, and offered him the lighted one I was smoking to light his with, when he innocently put the whole one in his pocket and the other one in his mouth, and walked off with a "muchas gracias," entirely unconscious of having practiced a good joke. I walked a mile to find another light. The trade wind blows from across the lake, and Granada is therefore a healthy place. Miasma will not cross any considerable surface of water, and we slept in hammocks stretched be tween trees on the shore of the lake with perfect impunity. The water of the lake is coolest at the surface, and is swarming with fish. Its beach is made up of magnetic iron-sand and pumice stone. Our second boat was at length finished, and we stowed our effects on board, with stores, and were ready to leave at short notice, on the arrival of the

It is well known that miasma is most active at night, and the danger is much less on the water than on the land. We were, therefore, impatient to get off from the shore, and, an American brig arriving in the course of the day, we lost no time in securing passage to New Orleans — for we cared little what port we landed at, provided it was in our native country — and went at once on board. It was named the Mechanic, of Bath (Me.), Cap tain Lawrence. The cabin was small and badly furnished, but it gave us a home, and we turned in and slept long and violently-. The next day the schooner Maria, fourteen days from New York, arrived, and home, with all its comforts, of the smallest of which we had been deprived so long, seemed almost at hand. About this time, Captain Hutchinson, of the brig Union, arrived, having been picked up in an open boat, with his mate and two seamen. His brig had been wrecked about three weeks be fore on Serrana Keys, while on his way from Chagres to New Orleans, with forty-five passen gers — returning Californians. His passengers were all safely landed, and his brig had worked over» the reef into still water; the stores were landed, and the company were as comfortable as they could be on a little bird island, without any prospect of speedy relief. After eleven days, the captain took the long boat with a crew, and endeavored to reach an island eighty miles to lee ward; but, owing to the same defect in his chart

It had rained that morning at Panama, and the sun was still obscured ; but the air was dense with heat and moisture, that hung as if in strata and folds about you, without a breath to disturb them — and to say we steamed and swel tered, during those four long hours there, would only half express our perspiring experience. All along the road, there was a tropical luxuriance and splendor, -which no word-painting can describe, and here in this jungle both seemed to culminate. What we in a sterner clime grow in hot-houses and conservatories, as rare exotics, there rioted in the open air, as well they might, and all nature seemed bursting with exuberance and richness. Under neath, grasses and shrubbery so dense, that only the machete could clear the way, or keep them under. Overhead, the lordly palm and gracious banana, with flowering vines, pendent, interlacing, creeping, and twin ing everywhere. Bread-fruit and bananas hung every where, in clusters as big as half-bushel baskets; and here and there, birds of brilliant plumage flitted to and fro, fit denizens with the chattering monkeys, and screaming parrots, of such a wilderness. The whole ride, indeed, through the heart thus of the tropics, after all, was a rare experience ; and the transition from the steamer to the railroad, notwithstanding the heat, a welcome change. The railroad itself seemed well built, and fairly man aged. It was said, indeed, to rest literally on human bodies, so many poor fellows perished in the deadly miasmas, while constructing it. The ties and sleepers were of lignum-vitæ, and the telegraph poles of terra-cotta or cement, as nothing else would withstand the insects and moisture of the Isthmus. The stations were well apart, and seemed maintained solely for the conveni-

It had been predicted that we should have to pass some months in Laos — a region of evil name, protected by the rocks with which its river bristles, and still more by the miasma exhaled by the sun's heat, from the curiosity or am bition of its neighbours. It was not, therefore, without some feeling of joy, almost of pride, that in thinking of the road we had already come, we recalled our hardships, running over them as a soldier does his wounds, and finding that we still survived. Our ranks were about to be thinned, but it was an act of our own will. M. de Lagree had sent away all the Europeans of our escort but one, the rest having shown that their courage was greater than then- resignation, and that they were fitter to fight visible enemies than to bear the enforced delays of our progress, and the annoyances of the climate. Attracted at first by the hope of adventure, they soon got an inkling of the monotonous life before them, and then* enthusiasm sank, as their eyes opened to the reali ties of the case. We fancied, moreover, that we had nothing to fear from the Laotians; for then extreme gentleness left, us without anxiety, so far as they were concerned. We were called, it is true, to pass through the midst of other popula tions of very different tempers, but they were still far dis tant ; and it was wise, since we could not in any case force the mandarins to do what we wanted, to make sure, at least, of the sympathy of the natives, by irreproachable conduct and strict discipline.

A large proportion of the Greeks under Turkish rule, especially those who are place holders and those who are engaged in gainful commer cial pursuits, prefer the proverb, " Let well alone," to that of " Nothing venture, nothing have." They dis trust the result of revolutionary movements, and the political restraints of King George's kingdom do not tempt them to change the temporal advantages of their present position for the chances of prospective inde pendence, however golden with patriotism. The Greeks in Turkey breathe an atmosphere of political and social impurity, which pervades all classes, from the sultan's household to the lowest menial at the custom-house, and from which foreign subjects — even foreign ministers — have not always remained untainted. It is a habit with certain writers to charge the Hellenic population in Turkey with the creation of this miasma of immorality and vice ; but the truth is, they only avail themselves of the existing laxity in all departments of the public service, and in all the circles of social exist ence, and by their extraordinary mental' vitality and shrewdness, turn the general debasement to their own advantage. When the Turks found themselves masters of Constantinople, they discovered that nothing- was wanting to their maintenance of power but one thing, and that one thing was brains.

In imitation of the Muslems, they give their religious teachers the names of Hoja (sheikh), and Dervish (religious devotee). We saw here an old man said to be 90 years of age, but strong and erect, who is called Dervish Hussein Baba. He seemed quite gratified by the proposal to draw his picture. I noticed that he had remarkably small hands and feet. Though many of these people are found in all the large towns of Turkey engaged in every trade, and filling every office in the gift of Government, yet they are mostly addicted to agri cultural pursuits : their women do not veil themselves in the presence of Christians, but only of Turks. Thursday, 2Sth. — The swamps of the Kaz Ova are in full sight below us. They do not affect the healths ulness of this place, because the wind does not blow from that direction during the fever season. In winter they are the great resort of ducks and wild geese, which give their name to the plain ; they are sometimes shot by means of flat boats launched upon the swamp, in which the sportsman hides himself under green boughs, and advances stealthily among the reeds. There are three places where the water is very deep. Our host thinks they cannot be drained by a cut to the river, w-hich he believes too high opposite the swamp. It is generally supposed that the intermittent fevers which prevail among the country houses situated farthest west in the neighbourhood of Tocat, owe their origin to the miasma borne from this swamp by the westerly winds.

Nobody could talk more understandingly, criticise more justly, or appreciate more fully everything in their authors that related to natural feeling ; and if this book ever gets out to them (as I mean it shall), I shall be more interested in knowing their opinion of it than that of most critics who shall overhaul me in the cities. It is the pride of our American system that such womanly culture can coexist in the Nebraska wilds. with those sturdy administrative qualities which subdue savagery into a home, and fight the battle for a civilization which shall presently come and build cities on their conquered field. Place on the frontiers of any other country in the world a family of women isolated from all the luxuries and softening influences proper to their sex, and after a few years have gone over their heads you will find a set of female boors living in a slovenly hut. But "the peasantry" have no status in America. The nearest approach to them which we found in all our journeying was here and 'there a houseful of unfortunate "Pikes" or "Butter nuts," whom slavery had degraded below the black level before they escaped from its miasma, and the first generation of whom still lay entangled in the accursed traditions of an accursed system, while the second and third were gradually struggling out into the light of new ideas.

I think them far superior to the roughs that lounge about the streets. Here is an athletic scamp. I admire his easy litheness and excel lent proportion of limb. He is a scamp and a tramp, but then he is such, on an intelligible æsthetical principle. He has flung himself down, in the pure physical enjoy ment of Use, just as a Neapolitan will bask in the sun shine, to enjoy the turf and the atmosphere. In his splendid animal life he will sleep for hours, unfearing draught or miasma, untroubled with ache or pain, ob taining something of a compensation for his negative troubles and privations. If you come to talk to the vagrant sons and daughters of poverty loitering till the Park is cleared, or even sleeping here the livelong night, you would obtain a clear view of that night side which is never far from the bright side of London. I am not sure that I might not commend such a beat as this to some philanthropist for his special attention. The handsome, wilful boy who has run away from home or school ; the thoughtless clerk or shopman out of work ; the poor usher, whose little store has been spent in illness ; the servant-girl who has been so long without a place, and is now hovering on the borders of penury and the extreme limit of temptation ; they are by no means rare, with their easily- yielded secrets, doubtless with some amount of im posture, and always, when the truth comes to be known, with large blame attachable to their faults or weakness, but still with a very large percentage where some sym-

The same features occur in every legend, and when these stories tell of innocent and helpless victims falling a prey to his hunger and his rage, we feel that we have before us features which, if they be drawn from the experience of past generations, yet appeal only too powerfully to our own. Do but tread our courts, our alleys, and our streets, and you will see that Grande Gueule is still being fed there on babies, and on maidens, and on the dumb beasts that perish. We read again of a dragon who lived in a morass, and whose breath slew all that passed that way. Was that story invented by a Lincoln shire peasant in the Fens, who had just eaten opium to keep off an attack of ague ? or was it dictated by a patient tossing in the delirium of a fever ? or told perhaps long ago on the pestilential Italian shore where Madonna Pia sighed out her brief history, how " Sienna me made, Maremma has undone " ? Down a French valley it seems, too, that there once rolled a dragon of huge length, whose heavy coils laid low the vines, the houses, and all the fruit-bearing trees, till, conquered by a saint, this monster lay at last chained and bound. Down that same valley, bordered by a hundred towers and towns, there still run the waves of Loire, and silver gilt they seem as any dragon-scales when they rattle over their sandy shallows, but they are terrible in flood- time as ever could have been the dragon of St. Julien : only now they also are in a manner chained, and held in by powerful leve'es and banks. These then would seem to be true stories of Dragons, and to point to a common truth, therefore it is that I propose with a key of truth to unlock the volume of the Dragon-myth, and to show not only evil personified in this form throughout a

But in the tables of mortality, neither these constant shocks, nor the equally constant politi cal disturbances, are credited with the short precarious tenure of human life in Lima. Like the inhabitants of some other cities we know of, they are their own deliberate murderers. They persist in trying to breathe air tainted by foul smells and decay, and bad water, and the result of the experiment is not encouraging, for those who are strong enough to fight the battle for existence against the evil-smelling heats bred from miasma and filth, become poor weak de generate creatures, whilst the more delicate individuals give up the struggle and die-young. The native dark races still linger round the ruined and overgrown temples and dwellings where their forefathers lived and worshipped, and the Tables of Returns for both Lima and Quito show a large pro portion of Indian inhabitants. Hewers of wood and drawers of water have these people become to their conquerors, but they still cherish the early traditions of their race, and look forward to a millennium — a time when Manco Capac and Mama Oello, the son and daughter of the Sun, will return to restore the old Inca dynasty, which they founded four centuries before the Spanish invasion and conquest of Peru. Some of the aborigines utterly refuse to adapt themselves to the strange faith and rule of the new comers, and prefer to wander, like gipsies, over the province, subsisting by selling balsams, herbs, and barks. There is one tribe in particular, called the Callavayas or Yungenas, which may be said to have

" To this the stereotyped answer runs : " There is no news ; I heard some lies only." From Kolobeng, as we stated before, the route had been due north, leaving Lake Ngami on the west, and by the 1st March they reached Kamakama, where no stay was made, as the pools along the route were dry ing up, and whence the road trended westwards. Ten days later the miasma from these stagnant, rapidly absorbed pools of rain-water caused fever to appear in the camp, and delayed them for more than a week. As soon as the sick had sufficiently recovered to be placed in the waggons, the expedition continued its course without halting, until the little hill N'gwa was reached. It is only 300 or 400 feet high, but appeared a lofty mountain to eyes accustomed for so long to a level plain. From this point the country became very beautiful, well-wooded and grassed, traversed by water-courses almost big enough to be called rivers. At last the Sanshureh River was reached and crossed — where the Chobe runs into it — with some difficulty, on a pon toon, the waggons being taken to pieces and carried over on canoes lashed together. In order to avoid the flooded lands to the north of the Chobe, they now turned sharp to the west, and on the 23rd May reached Linyanti, the capital town of the Makololo, and only a short distance from their camp of 185 1. Here the good Missionary halted, and attempted to teach and tame the wild people about him. Their progress was but slow, the alphabet proving a formidable asses-bridge to the dusky scholars.

When I asked Mussoudi where the people had gone to, he replied, " God has taken most of them, but some have gone to Udoe." The surest blow ever struck -at the tribe of the Wakami was indeed given by the hand of God ; and, to use the words of the Diwan, ■" God's power is wonderful, and who can resist him !" I again resort to my Diary, and extract the following : April 30. h. — Passing Msuwa, we travelled hurriedly through the jungle which saw such hard work with us when going to Unyanyembe. What dreadful odors and indescribable loathing this jungle produces ! It is so dense that a tiger could not crawl through* it; it is so impenetrable that an elephant could not force his way ! Were a bottleful of concentrated miasma, such as we inhale herein, collected, what a deadly poison, instantaneous in its action, undiscoverable in its properties, would it be ! I think it would act quicker than chloroform, be as fatal as prussic acid. Horrors upon horrors are in it. Boas above our heads, snakes and scorpions under our feet.

It is possible that serious loss has been sustained, from the evidences of the effects of the storm in the interior.

Daily the country advanced in my estima tion, for hitherto I felt that I was but obeying orders ; and sickly as it might be, I was in duty bound to go on ; but, for fear of the terrible fever, made more terrible by the feverish perspective created in my ima gination by the embitterment of Capt. Burton's book, I vowed I would not step one foot out of my way. Shall I inform you, reader, what ' The Lake Regions of Central Africa,' and subsequently the reports of European merchants of Zanzibar, caused me to imagine the • interior was like ? It was that of an immense swamp, curtained round about with the fever — "a species of Yellow Jack," which was sure, if it did not kill me outright, so to weaken body and brain as to render me for the future a helpless imbecile. In this swamp, which extended over two hundred miles into the interior, sported an immense number of hippopo tami, crocodiles, alligators, lizards, tortoises, and toads ; and the miasma rising from this vast cataclysm of mud, corruption, and putrescence, was as thick and sorely depressing as the gloomy and suicidal fog of London. Ever in my mind in the foreground of this bitter picture were the figures of poor Burton and Speke, " the former a confirmed invalid, and the other perma nently affected " in the brain by this fever. The worm wood and fever tone of Capt. Burton's book I regarded as the result of African disease. But ever since my arrival on the mainland, day by day the pall-like
003478840	003478840_128	nOW I FOUND LIVINGSTONE. 102 order to give the dilapidated soldiers and animals time to recruit. On the 8th we continued our journey, and arrived at Msuwa. This march will be remembered by our caravan as the most fatiguing of all, though the distance was but ten miles. It was one continuous jungle, except three interjacent glades of narrow limits, which gave us three breathing pauses in the dire task of jungle travelling. The odour emitted from its fell plants was so rank, so pungently acrid, and the miasma from its decayed vege tation so dense, that I expected every moment to see my self and men drop down in paroxysms of acute fever. Happily this evil was not added to that of loading and unloading the frequently falling packs. Seven soldiers to attend seventeen laden donkeys were entirely too small a number while passing through a jungle ; for while the path is but a foot wide, with a wall of thorny plants and creepers bristling on each side, and pro jecting branches darting across it, with knots of spikey twigs stiff as spike-nails, ready to catch and hold any thing above four feet in height, it is but reasonable to suppose that donkeys standing four feet high, with loads measuring across from bale to bale four feet, would come to grief. This grief was of frequent recurrence here, causing us to pause every few minutes for re arrangements. So often had this task to be performed, that the men got perfectly discouraged, and had to be spoken to sharply before they set to work. By the time I reached Msuwa there was nobody with me and the ten donkeys I drove, but Mabruk the Little, who, though generally stolid, stood to his work like a man. Bombay and Uledi were far behind, with the most jaded donkeys. Shaw was iu charge of the cart, and his experiences were most bitter, as he informed

I could not possibly leave him at Kiora, death would soon overtake him there ; but how long I could convey a man in such a state, through a country devoid of carriage, was a question to be resolved by circumstances. On the 11th of May, the third and fifth caravans, noAV united, followed up the right bank of the Mukondokwa, through fields of holcus, the great MukondokAva ranges rising in higher altitude as we proceeded west, and enfolding us in the narrow river valley round about. We left Muniyi Usagara on our right, and soon after found hill-spurs athwart our road, which we were obliged to ascend and descend. A march of eight miles from the ford of Misonghi brought us to another ford of the Mukondokwa, where we bid a long adieu to Burton's road, which led up to the Goma pass and up the steep slopes of Rubeho. Our road left the right bank and followed the left over a country quite the reverse of the Mukondokwa Valley, enclosed between mountain ranges. Fertile soils and spontaneous vegetation reeking Avith miasma, and over powering from their odour, we had exchanged for a drouthy wilderness of aloetic and cactaceous plants, where the kolquall and several thorn bushes grew paramount. Instead of the tree-clad heights, slopes and valleys, instead of cultivated fields, AA'e saw noAV the confines of an uninhabited wilderness. The hill-tops were bared of their bosky crowns, and revealed their rocky natures bleached Avhite by rain and sun. Nguru Peak, the loftiest of the Usagara cones, stood right shoulder-

In the original construction of the city, these hills probably presented serious obstacles to our worthy forefathers. Some were steep and unsightly, and required much grading, but the gradual expansion of the town enabled its builders to trim the rough edges, and cut down only so much as would relieve their precipitous character, without impairing their beauty and picturesqueness. These hills rise one above another step by step, until, on the outer boundaries of the city as now constituted, at almost any point, magnificent views of Balti more, its harbor and the Chesapeake Bay, can be obtained. It may be also added that THE CATHEDRAL. because of its peculiar topography a person walking in any direction for three or four hundred yards, can obtain panoramic views of different sections of the city, such as can be had in few other places in the world. The Patapsco River with its inlets indents the land upon which Baltimore is built to a very considerable extent, forming natural exten sions for wharf-fronts, and at the same time adding greatly to the beauty of the harbor, and the general landscape. Perhaps at some early period in the history of our city the marshes which formed at the head of these inlets, by their malaria may have produced those bilious diseases so frequent along the water courses of the Chesapeake, and a citizen of to-day feels doubtless a sensation of compassion, not unmixed however with self-congratulation, when he thinks of his ancestor, racked and tortured with the shaking-ague as he hurried from his morning meal to attend to the wants of his palsied customers. The marshes have long since been drained, the shores about the inlets converted into substantial wharves for the accomodation of our rapidly increasing commerce, and the miasma no longer rises from the lowlands, to disconcert the calculations of our citizens.

Groups continued around the corpse until it was enveloped in a blanket and buried in the earth. He was buried by a detail from General Lane's command. September 25. Before leaving, General Lane re viewed all the troops now concentrated at this point; the heat was blistering, and ill-health and ill-humor sat upon the countenances of many. In the evening immense flocks of parrots flew over our camp, going in a north-westerly direction. They invariably fly in pairs ; among the tens of thousands that went screech ing and palavering in the air each pair was notice able ; if there were an odd one, a bachelor or a spin ster, it might be distinguished on the flanks of the main body of couples. After night-fall, the perfume of the vanilla is very observable in the miasma which rises like a fog from the rank vegetation. This fog is dense, humid, and unpleasant to all one's sensibili ties ; you feel that there is poison in its vapors ; our sick list shows its power, and the mounds of upturned earth, its effects upon the troops. I would single out this place for its unhealthfulness, as the most to be dreaded, not excepting Chagres, on the Isthmus, in North America. September 27. An express reached us to-night from above, bringing the extraordinary intelligence that General Santa Anna was in the vicinity of Puebla, the garrison of which had been driven into the cita del by the inhabitants, and that a general stampede 21

I have however known many coughs and pains about the pectoral regions, most promptly and effectually cured by drinking the mineral waters, but the cough and the pains in the chest were dependent upon a diseased ac tion in one or more of the digestive and assimilating organs, and not on that pathological state of the lungs which is phthisis pulmonalis. My advice to all who are laboring under this disease, is, not to drink of any one of our mineral springs whether recently or long since dis covered. Diseases peculiar to the Southern and Western states, and which are caused by miasma, are much relieved by a few weeks' sojourn at the Springs. The stimulating and dry atmosphere of Saratoga county is well calculated to remove diseases which occur in the damp miasmatic climates which prevail along the seaboard, and the lakes and the rivers of the Western and Southwestern states. And the morbid condition of the digestive organs, which so frequently attends bilious diseases, is often removed by the use of the water, because it acts powerfully on the secretions of the liver, the skin, and the kidneys. Another class of patients which receive much benefit here, are those who have, by too close and protracted application to business, over-taxed the brain and nervous system. This class of patients can spend a few weeks at Saratoga, and be speedily relieved from their anxious cares and labors without becoming impatient of their

The negroes were too valuable to be used up in any such way; poor foreigners, gathered in great cities, were the victims, and it appears that our regiment is in this department to be used in the same way that the foreigners were." The hot hours of the day are almost gone. I have been looking with curiosity at the row of sharp sticks, about four feet long, which Bailey has stuck so as to turn up a little all around his mud fort, about half way up its side. These poor negroes are not so stupid that they cannot understand the ridiculous nature of their recent labors. This fort looks very much as if it is to be a master-piece of the same kind of work as our iron clad batteries toward Pontchitoula, built to be abandoned immediately. Night has fallen. The usual miasmas, mingled with the dark ness, obscure everything. Nothing has been heard from the Barataria. A large dead tree, dry enough to burn, has been found, and is flaming and sparkling fifty feet in the air, intended to show where the landing place is. There is a general still ness, broken only by the doleful shrieks of owls occasionally answering one another, and by the voices and laughter of men at the flickering camp fires. Cannon shots have been heard in the direction where our gunboat was last seen. Several officers are out on the timbers of the burned bridge, listening and look ing. A red spot of fire is seen across the lake. Gradually it flickers up; then flames illuminate that part of the horizon. Soon comes the boom of a heavy gun ; then other cannon shots are heard. Now the discharges are in quick succession, and seem like those of a battery of light guns, which must be on the shore. Again a solitary twelve-pounder shot. A consider able pause; two or three other reports, apparently from the light on shore.

The air ably free from the advantageously situate than is dry and bracing, and remark miasma arising from vegetable decomposition, or the vicinity of marsh lands. The dryness of the air is a natural consequence of the nature of the soil on which the town is built. On the east it consists of coombe rock ; in the valley of the Steine the silt and coombe rock resting upon chalk is covered with a layer of shingle; about West street the natural soil is clay, which gradually increases in depth. The clay has, however, been so excavated for building and brickmaking, that little or no inconvenience is experienced from the retention of moisture by the soil, especially when we take into consideration the artificial character of the roads and esplanade, which do not retain moisture, and the gravelly soil of the country to the west. Medical men, who have written on the sanatory effects of Brighton air, have divided the town into three districts, each of which possesses a different climate. The eastern division is characterised by its extreme dryness and the bracing quality of the air, which, except during high winds, is exempt from the saline particles which are suspended iu the atmosphere of the lower parts of the town. The central portion, according to Dr. Wio-an " differs but little from any inland town in a low situa-
002466369	002466369_60	55 various ailments ; since the injudicious choice of a residence, without reference to its sanatory peculiarities, may be attended with the worst consequences ; and, on the contrary, a removal to another locality may be followed by almost immediate benefit. In remarking on the climate of Brighton, it will be proper to mention two circumstances, which, in the opinion of medical men, have a marked effect upon the salubrity of the whole town, namely, the entire exemption from the miasma arising from marshes, and from the delta of rivers. It is also free from the decomposition of vegetable matter, and of the manure with which garden grounds are frequently dressed in the vicinity of towns, and which too often proves a fertile source of fevers. The changes of temperature at Brighton are very great, the thermometer, on the same spot, sometimes varying from ten to fifteen degrees in a few hours. The temperature which pre vails in different parts of the town, varies in proportion to their exposure to the sun or wind. On the Cliff one may experience the warmth of Naples, while through the streets which have an opening north and south, there rushes a stream of cold air. The common expression, that there is a great coat differ ence between the Cliff and the transverse streets, during the prevalence of the north wind, scarcely expresses the great variation of temperature ; the one is frequently summer, the other winter. The invalid cannot be exposed to these changes with impunity, and the pleasure of sunning one's self on the under-cliff walk leading to the Chain-pier, where, on a winter day, the thermometer stands at 55° or 60°, is counterbalanced by the cold blast which one encounters on emerging from this sheltered spot. It is safer in these cases, when visiting the most inviting promenade on the Cliff, not to linger too long in the afternoon. As the town is well drained, well paved, and the roads well scavenged, the pedestrian may

The immediate mourners stand around, dressed in white. Often the ashes are gathered up, and preserved in urns. how shall we dispose of our dead? Touching the removal of the dead, these have been the common methods : interment, exposing upon towers of silence, mummification, and incinerating or burning upon the prepared pyre. Considering the loathsome changes of decomposition, with the liberation and discharging of poi sonous gases into the atmosphere, the burying of deceased bodies is open to serious objections. It is well known that sulphuretted and phosphuretted gases are active poisons ; and their influence, when breathed even in infinitesimal quantities, must be deleterious to health. Dr. Walker, a London surgeon, shows in his " Gatherings from Graveyards," that from the surface of the ground, above dead bodies, there are continually rising poisonous miasmas. These impregnate and infect the germ-cells and dust of the air breathed ; and thus disease is borne upon the winds. There are few unhealthier places than the cemeteries of crowded cities. In them epidemics and pestilences often originate. People should avoid rather than visit them. In the early history of Judaism, to merely touch a' dead body rendered the person " unclean for seven days." Extravagant coffins, pompous ceremonies, costly monu ments, gloved priests, expensive mourning apparel, and bearing corpses long distances for burial, all violate the genius of that Spiritual phUosophy which sees that the spirit ' ' Sings now an everlasting song Amidst the trees of life." The opposition of churchmen to cremation arises from their theological beUef that graveyards are temporary resting- 15

This did not prove to be so in our case, for we found three nests more or less full of honey — one in the trunk of a hollow tree, another in the ground in the hole of some animal, and the last in a deserted ant-heap. It is said the Kafirs are ungrate ful to these birds, and do not leave them any honey, therefore they are spiteful to other passers by. Cer tainly this bird instinct is a remarkable instance of God's providence for hungry man, who otherwise would starve in the midst of plenty. On the left bank of the Sabie, below the Sand Eiver, the hills terminate rather abruptly in a prominent kopjie, and their elevation subsides gradually into the undulating plain falling southward and eastward. About two or three miles from the Sand Eiver I selected a deep nullah for the night's lodging. There was not much water, nor was it good ; but one side of the gulf being rocky afforded a dry floor, and the great quantity of dead wood lying about enabled us to make a roaring fire, to keep away the miasma from the marsh and reeds on the other side. There were also beauti ful large lofty trees, wild plums, under whose spreading branches shelter from the dew was obtained. Here I made my bed and drank the tea, which was all that was left me, sharing it with the boys. In the sand at the bottom of the ravine there was one solitary print of a horse's foot of some time past. How strange it looked ! I thought if I could only, in the Mesmerist's fashion, make some passes over it, I might have a revelation, and the history attached to it. Vain hope ; it remained dumb ! I had an immense dry tree cut doAvn, and, lighting a fire under both ends, dried the air and warmed my hungry body famously. The night was splendid. Lying at the bottom of the nullah, the steep banks of which, in this gloom, acted as a sort of telescope,

It was jungle still, and the terrible bad road continued just the same for a long time. By-and-by we entered a valley between mountain spurs, clothed in wood — one noble monarch of the range ridged with snow, the same we had seen in the morning rising up to the left of us ; but it was the only one snow-capped in the chain. Strings of laden mules often met us, and later we passed several wild-looking encampments of muleteers. The damp miasmas of the jungle had greatly increased my earache, and I had toothache besides ; in fact, I was ache all over. I hoped that when we came to a drier region that these afflictions would cease. Our track had been lying along the valley near the bed of a river, but now sloped upwards up the mountain-sides — up, and sometimes down, as ravines and gullies had to be crossed, our horses floundering terribly all the way through mud, over rocks, and through water. I noticed among the trees that there were a great many beeches, and I was surprised to see the copper beech among them, having always thought it was only a civilised variety ; but it was only a portion of the foliage that was coppered. It was not autumnal tints stealing over the tree, but the natural colour of the leaves. I took particular notice, that I might be positive. There were also elms, tulip-trees, and acacias, and some others which I did not know, and I think I saw a few oaks. And now the mud began to dry up, the road got harder, the water less, the trees fewer, and in a few minutes more we were on ground of a different kind — we were in a diffe rent climate altogether — so dry in comparison, the change began as we neared the top of the range. And now I galloped after Mirsa; it was slightly down-hill, we raced

The lakes abound in fish, and are the homes of multi tudes of frogs. It is from these lakes, also, that the natives draw their supplies of drinking-water, but it is necessary to explain that they only drink it when converted into capata. The Luinas are no great tillers of the land, but they are great rearers of cattle. Their herds constitute their chief wealth, and in the milk of their cows they find their principal nourishment. A Luina's property may be said to consist of cows and women. The basis of their food is milk, either fresh or cur dled, and sweet-potatoes. Maize-flour is used to make capata, mixed with the flour of massambala, the chief article of cultivation in that country. The people work in iron, and all their arms and tools are ma nufactured at home. They use no knives, and one cannot fail to admire their wood-carvings, more especially on considering that they are untouched by a knife, but are the result of what in our eyes would be most unmanageable im plements. In the Lui they em ploy but two ; the rough work is done by the hatchet and the fine by the assegai.

The mine is the most potent principle of the develop ment of a virgin soil. It is the most powerful incen tive to the colonisation of a new country. The diamond flashes, — the grain of gold scintillates, — the block of coal sparkles,- — the mine yields from its cavernous depths, copper, iron and lead, and lo ! — in the desert, till then pronounced sterile, — all around the lead, copper, coal, gold and diamond, life springs up, a town is created, and progress marches with giant strides, by the aid of its grandest elements, electricity and steam. But yesterday, the rudimentary hoe of the abori gines scraped its inch or two of ground, and to-day the powerful traction engine, startling the ear with its sharp whistle (the exulting cry of progress) sets in motion ploughs which cut deeply into the earth, un touched since its geological formation, and score in symmetrical furrows the piece of soil which till then bore no other configuration than that imposed upon it by the laws of nature. Where but yesterday a roaring river presented an insuperable barrier to the onward steps of the rare wayfarer, to-day a bridge, constructed of iron girders, arranged and united in perfect harmony by the sublime laws of science, yields an easy passage to a dense population, who disregard, as unworthy of their notice, the waters tossing and foaming beneath their feet. The marsh which but yesterday exhaled pestilential miasma, becomes to-day converted into a graceful park, whose groups of trees modify the very atmosphere and climate. The iron which, wrested only yesterday and in the rudest manner from the earth, barely served for the imperfect arrow-head or barbarous assegai, runs

TT was on striking our tent at this time, after an outspan ■*- of a day and night, that attention was forcibly attracted to a peculiar fetid odour which had less or more been experienced all the way throughout this valley. On re moving the waterproof covering from the floor of the tent, there arose an effluvium which was almost overpowering ; and after a time it was found to proceed from certain cracks or fissures in the ground, some of which admitted a rod to a depth of from fifteen to twenty feet. Our waterproof floorcloth had prevented the escape of this noxious malaria from these fissures during our encampment of not less than twenty-four hours, and consequently such an accumulation was unbearable. It was a deathly smell. No rain had yet fallen here, the soil was~of a dark, porous, boglike character, and the surface had cracked while being baked by the sun. During the rainy season putrefying animal and vegetable matter, hurled from the higher to these lower lands, fills up every crevice, and is speedily encrusted by tropical heat. The rottenness of years thus enclosed, in process of fermen tation, through these fissures exhales miasma deadly to human life. But to this very state of matters, proving so deleterious to man, does the valley of the Limpopo owe its amazing fecundity in "spontaneous herbage, flowers, forests, and fruits ; yielding shelter with abundance of food to birds and beasts in countless numbers. The valley here, exceedingly '.broad and level, is, after the rains have fallen, covered with a rich pasturage some five or six inches in height, springing up as if by magic with a regularity equal to the best cultivated corn.

From the days of Herodotus to those of Livingstone, it has been only partially traversed and described in fragments. Natural, climatic, and political barriers have stood in the way of explorations : insidious miasma evanescing from her river banks — pestilential malaria welling and exuding from her swamps — trackless deserts — internecine wars, promoted by traders in slaves; such are a few of the obstacles which have proved sufficient to deter ordinary adventurers. Never theless, daring men have penetrated her mysteries, and by their revelations of scenes beyond have stimulated the enterprise of worthy successors, who from time to time have shown that this vast continent contains almost every object worthy the employment of the human mind, whether in search of improvement or amusement. Still, in a great measure, its history remains shrouded in obscurity, and its present condition comparatively enigmatical and unknown. Africa, therefore, presents a large field of a most interesting character for speculation, travel, or research, and doubtless will continue so until thoroughly explored. As to the extent of this country, it is somewhat difficult for ordinary minds to comprehend, covering as it does over twelve millions of square miles. Its population is composed of numerous tribes, if not races, varying in physical char acteristics, and diverse in their manners. They range from the lowest type to the highest caste in the human family. The general features of the country seem to rival the immensity of area occupied. Her mountains, emantled by the clouds, having their virgin bosoms perpetually snow veiled in spotless purity, appear fitting altars in the temple of Nature for intercommunion of material creation with the ethereal universe beyond. Some of these mountains reach an altitude over 13,000 feet, and where they have been rent asunder, earth's story may be read in the testimony presented. Cataracts and waterfalls, careering down their

There is no uniformity in India, and the varied wildness of the country is equalled by the varied picturesqueness of its inhabitants. There is no doubt that the Indian climate is some- Avhat dangerous for Europeans, and it is absurd to deny or ignore the fact, as some people seem inclined to do. The most perilous part of the year is the month of Oc tober and the commencement of November, Avhen the country is drying up after the great rains of the south west monsoon. At that time the climate is very damp and hot, and poisonous miasmas arise from the swampy ground, and from the immense quantities of decaying vegetation. But yet, if the European visitor is to see India in its most striking aspect, he must not shirk the trying month of October ; for the country is then ap parelled in green and gold. Vast plains which, a month or two later, appear almost like tracts of desert, are clothed Avith verdure ; the tropical luxuriance of leaf and flower is in its fullest ; and all day the land is flooded Avith rich golden sunlight. From that period, on to the beginning of March, the climate is delightful, though, except on the mountains, it is not very faATourable to human activity ; but it is a great mistake to suppose that this pleasant season is altogether safe. On the plains at least it is not so cold as to allow of clothing being worn of sufficient thickness to guard effectually against the extremely rapid radiation of heat from the human body, especially at the fall of eve ; the chills thus arising are frequently immediate or exciting causes of fever and dysentery ; the traveller has often to pass suddenly from ovenlike places into cold Avinds, and mal aria is still rife. It is extremely dangerous to enter some

A railway is in course of construction, or is to be constructed, which will greatly facilitate access to it. As it is, we have to go eleven hours by rail from Calcutta, four hours in a river steamboat, 124 miles in a dak gharri, bullock shigram, or mail-cart, then fourteen miles on horseback or in a palanquin to the foot of the hills, and by similar means of carriage up to the top of them, in order to reach Darjiling. In the rains this is a horrible journey to make ; and, except in the very hot season, the miasma of the Terai or jungle forest between Siligari and Pankabarri is so deadly that the traveller is always advised to pass it by daylight — a proposal Avhich in all proba bility he will be glad to accede to, unless familiarity with tigers and wild elephants has bred in him a due contempt for such road-fellows. This makes Darjiling not a ATery easy place to get at, and it has the addi tional disadvantage of being exceedingly wet and cold during the south-Avest monsoon — that is to say, from any time in the end of June till the beginning of October ; but, notAvithstanding these drawbacks, it recommends itself to the tourist who does not care to attempt tent-life in the mountains, on account of its magnificent view of the Himalaya, and its vicinity to the very highest peaks of that mighty range. Gaurisankar, or Mount Everest, the culminating point of the earth's surface, and which rises to the height of 29,002 feet above the level of the sea, is in Nepal, and is not visible from the hill-station we speak of ; but it can be seen, when weather alloAvs, from an elevation only a day or two's journey from Ddrjilino-.

For three months of excessive caution, these heroic men had fought their way up to within four miles of Richmond, during which the Confederates had every opportunity to rally all their men, and prepare for the conflict ; and they had used it with the utmost industry and skill. After one continuous battle, lasting seven days, during which they had suffered in credible hardships, amid the carnage of battle-fields and the mire and miasma of the swamps, and seen more than fifteen thousand of their brave comrades slaughtered, wounded, or captured, they had at length wrenched victory from the grasp of their deadly enemies, and were yet eighty-six thou sand men of unfaltering courage and unconquerable prowess; but they were now to leave their fields of heroic daring in disgrace ! Never was obedience a sterner test of loyalty ; but they obeyed. The campaign of the Peninsula was over ; and our enraged, dispirited army must haste to unite with Pope's command to save Washington. Cedar Mountain, and " the second Bull Run " as it is com monly called, followed not long after; and, while men and parties differed as to the responsibility, the disgrace came upon the nation to heighten the dissatisfaction with the con duct of the war. Why were all these disasters ? Why did not our brave and superb army of the Potomac capture the rebel capital ? Why, instead, must our own capital be menaced in conse quence of disgraceful defeat, when our forces were apparent ly strong enough to achieve victory ? By many it will be answered, they were not well commanded ; by others, that they were not properly re-enforced, and were attempting impossibilities. Only one answer, however, can be final. The nation was not yet ready to do justice. If we had closed the war then, there would have been no proclamation of liberty.

Emancipation from the depleting influences of heat almost unbearable, for the bracing and life-giving breezes which blow over regions of eternal ice and snow. But even in these days it is wonderful to what an extent ignorance prevails about the more unfrequented parts of India ; for it is not generally known, except as a mere abstract truth, that in this vast continent — asso ciated as it is in the purely English mind with scorching heat and arid plains, stretching from horizon to horizon, relieved by naught save belts of palm -girt jungle, the habitat of the elephant, the tiger, and the deadly snake — every variety of climate may be found, from the sultry heat and miasma of the tropical valley, to the tempera ture of the Poles. Is not India, indeed, almost exclusively regarded as a land of songless birds arrayed in brightest plumage ; of gorgeous butterflies and 'atlas' moths; of cacao-nuts, and dates, and pines more luscious than anything of which the classic Pomona could boast ? — a land also where snakes sit corkscrew-like at the foot of one's bed, and wild beasts take shelter in one's ' bungalow ' ; and where her Majesty's liege subjects, whose fate it is to be exiled there, are exposed to the alternate processes of roasting under a tropical sun, and melting beneath a punkah ?

This dilemma could be no great wonder to the friend to whom it was related, who knew that the poor lunatic ate nothing but this simple aliment at any of his meals."* His eyes were made the fools of his other senses, spreading before his deluded vision a splendid banquet, while taste remained true to nature, and spoiled all his ideal dainties by not taking part in the deception. There are certain states of mind in which we are carried, in our ideas, beyond the ordinary routine of thought and the influence of customary impression. This may arise from many sources — it may be caused by certain medicinal or morbid agents, as opium, nitrous oxide, and febrile miasma. But that to which I now allude is not produced by any of these ; it is a condition of mind the consequence of great excite ment, when, on the eve of some great enterprise — of some literary undertaking — about the success of which we are un certain, the senses, though wandering over the forms of out ward objects, take little cognizance of their presence. The mind, at these periods, throws no part of its being into the actions of the senses ; they are inert and powerless. All our mental faculties are concentrated upon the one great object of our anxiety. There are many persons in whom this state of mental concentration is habitual. When alone, from the activity and vigour of their fancies, some novel idea soon intrudes, becomes cherished and isolated. They create, and are charmed with the productions of their power, and are so lost in admiration of the beauties of their mental visions, or so occupied in their arrangement, that they lose all con trol over their senses, which thus become liable to hallu cination.

It turned out that our flight was unnecessary, for while we were going one way it was making for the water in the opposite direction. Crossing the narrow creek it landed on the opposite side, Avhere all efforts to dislodge it by hauling on the rope proved unavailing, till at last the hook pulled off the line, and the cay-man was free to go anywhere it chose to digest the hook. MeanAvhile many other cay-mans, attracted by the smell of the blood of the bush hog and the splashing of the hooked one, collected around in such numbers that at one time we feared they would come ashore aud attack us. They re mained about all night ; and many times I was awoke by hearing single combats going on amongst their ranks, the splashing noise of which was accompanied by heavy tail blows and loud belching sounds. As to the stink of musk, it was simply abominable, floating like a deadly7 miasma round our camp, and finding its way even to our palates.

Upon the banks of the river in this part I saw the beautiful Urua palm (Attalea speciosa) growing, for the first time ; the sin gular arrangement of the upper portions of its leaf stems, whereby its leaves stand edgeways in planes radiating from the tree's centre outAvards, strikes one at once as peculiar and graceful.

The United States, in extinguishing the title could give him better and more extensive hunting grounds beyond the Mississippi, and hence Georgia was content to surrender her magnificent territory to the United States, provided they would remove the Indian at once. In consenting thus to restrict her right of soil and her sovereignty, Georgia looked, with confidence in the plighted faith of the Union, to the prompt removal of the Indians, and the speedy settle ment of the vacant territory. It was in 1802 that the cession was made. Twenty years had passed away. New States had been organ ized and received into the Union from even beyond the Mississippi river, and still the Federal Government, as though determined to prevent the development of the Gulf States, had not extinguished the Indian titles in Georgia, nor in Alabama and Mississippi. Still the savages hovered on the Georgia frontier and pressed back the step of civilization. It was as though a deadly miasma rested upon the brow of the State ; and energy, enlightenment and progress held back from the contagion. Is it wonderful that Georgia at last resolved to do what the United States, after accepting her imperial grant, had failed to do ? The slavery agitation had begun to raise its head. The Missouri question had aroused the Freesoilers to active exertions, and growing out of that body of agi tators was a class of humanitarians who believed, or affected to believe, in the equality of all men before the law. With them the Caucasian, the Negro and the Indian were entitled to the same consideration; and they would listen to no argument drawn from the dif ference in origin, habits and circumstances of the races

Armory Hill was a pine plain, with an occasional patch of oak undergrowth, and nearer the " hasseky marish," back of the library building, stood a fine oak grove, with sentinel elms on the outskirts, among silver and white poplars and willows. The many and clear springs kept the marsh from stagnation, and gave all the fertility and warmth, without the miasma of the lowdands. Opposite the Dwight store, (Webber's corner), was the house of Luke Bliss, a man of fine presence and courtly manners, a representative at the General Court, and leader of the village choir. He and his brother owned most of the land between the present Watershops and the Armory. On the corner of Meeting-house lane and Main street, was a wooden store and dwelling-house owned by Moses Bliss, a shoemaker. The property came into the hands of the Lombard family eleven years later. Below Jonathan Dwight's house was a dwelling, where Homer Foot & Co. now are, which, in 1800, became Bates' tavern. Then came the Collins homestead, the Moses Bliss place, and the " old gaol " tavern, partly on the Union House site, the log "gaol" being in the rear. This gloomy, colonial lock-up was furnished with heavy shackles and stocks, and clumsy padlocks. Below this (north corner of Howard and Main streets), was the

I was shown a little north of the town a place where the Dutch, true to their national instincts, began a canal to supply Loanda with sweet and wholesome drinking material and water communication ; others place it with more probability near the confluence of the Cuanza and the Lucala, the first great northern fork, where Massangano was built by the Conquistadores. This "leat" was left incomplete, the terminus being three miles from St. Paul's ; the Governor-General Jose de Oliveira Barbosa, attempted to restore it, but was prevented by con siderations of cost. Calumbo must be a gruesome place to all ex cept its natives. Whilst Loanda has improved in climate since Captain Owen's day (1826), this has become deadly as Rome in 1873.

Lovely as is the situation, the inhabitants of Banias look wretched, pallid, and yellow, and the very infant at the breast has ague stamped on its face.

There is actually a village policeman, and a Kadi from Damascus, from whom we had a visit, as well as from the village sheikh, and the proprietor of the olive-grove in which we camped, and who invited us to stay under his shade as long as we pleased. L. and B — t had been here for some time, and we made Banias our head-quarters for a few days longer, being well rewarded by a harvest of specimens both of fauna and flora, in the collection of which we were heartily assisted by the villagers. But there is one thing that impresses Banias more deeply on the heart than its beauty, its ruins, or its natural his tory. Into the coasts of Cæsarea Philippi our Redeemer came. Among these rocks St. Peter confessed His divinity — that confession which was the "Rock of the Church." Six days at least did He sojourn here. From hence He took the chosen three up into that mountain of Hermon behind, and was transfigured before them. Here was set that wondrous seal to the resurrection of the body, as well as to His Godhead. Here His work of teaching was nearly finished. Hence He set His face for the last time to go np to Jerusalem, and here unfolded His coming passion. Perhaps it was on the open space in the pathway that leads up to the mountain (the only one up from Banias) that He healed the demoniac boy, and taught His disciples the power of faith.

Certainly a justifiable motive was wanting to induce me so to act, because the innocent as well as the guilty equally suffered ; but to speak the truth, my real object was to ascer tain the effect my bullet would have on a great gathering of individuals of this species. It was, however, a destruction not only useless, but blame able, because the vultures render these countries a signal service in rapidly absorbing quantities of offal that would otherwise contaminate the air with deliterious miasma." Of the ostrich I have also a word to say, not, however, as regards its natural history, &o, of which, in my former works I entered into rather full particulars, both in consequence of having recently discovered what, from an early period of my wanderings, I had suspected, viz., that another species of that bird, one quite new to science, exists in Southern Africa, a fact that may interest many. In the common species the male is black, with white tail and wings, whilst the female is of a greyish colour. Of the new species I have not an entire specimen so as to be enabled to give an accurate description of the entire bird; still I possess sufficient data to enable me to vouch for the correctness of my statement, having three pieces or portions of skin of two males, one female, and a young one, apparently about half grown. The male bird would seem to differ but little from the well-known African species, except in size, it being somewhat larger ; the great and specific difference lies with the female and the

They were not ends, but means. Thus the very separation of the Jews from idolaters, and their education by rite and ceremony, were in order that in the fulness of time there should be realised in the best way a holy brotherhood of men, without caste, but all one in Christ Jesus. The water was care fully drawn off from the swamp with its miasma, and gathered together into a reservoir, but only that in the end it might irrigate the world. But it helps us to realise the power of a sacred custom to remember that some years after our Lord's resur rection it required a miracle to convince St. Peter that he could eat with a Gentile, and that Caste was no more. Yet even after this he " dissembled " at Antioch, and was rebuked by St. Paul for his fear of the " high-caste " brethren from Jerusalem ! May this lead us to sympathise with the difficulties of the Hindoo ! Marvellous indeed are the power and endurance of such an organization as this, that can dominate over all those political and social changes which, in other respects, alter the relative position of its possessors as to wealth or rank, whether in the army or in the civil service. But Brahminism does more than make each man a member of this compact mass. Having fixed him there, it holds him fast, and governs him as a mere thing, in which no personality, and consequently no will, is recognised, save that measure which is required to consent to the destruction of his being, or its subordination, at least, to a system of mechanical rule's that fashion his whole inward and outward life. As far almost as it is possible to conceive, that life is every day and in everything the obedient slave of " religion ; " not, of course, in the sense which we attach to the expression — that of all things being done, endured, or enjoyed in a right spirit, or according to the rule of eternal righteousness towards God and man — but accord ing to fixed authoritative rules, professing to embrace the whole B B

A published report made to Lincoln, by four returned Andersonville prisoners alleged, that out of a population of about 36,000 at that pen, six thousand or one sixth of the whole, died between the 1st of February and the 1st of August, 1864. Now at Elmira, the quota was not made up till the last of August, so that September was the first month during which any just proportion could be taken, and out of less than 9,500 prisoners there at that time, 386 died during that month. The same rate of mortality for six months, would give 2316 or nearly one fourth of the whole. A deduction must be made, arising from the fact, that as the whole number decreased by deaths, so the deaths might be expected to decrease, but making every allowance, the mor tality will appear to be as great in this model prison as in the worst "pen" in the South, and at Elmira it resulted, in the majority of cases, from causes that the government could have controlled. During the last six weeks of my prison life, it was my duty to make out the morning report of the deaths, so I speak by the card as to these matters. And apropos of this Death Record, two facts therein were quite remarkable ; so much so that I called the attention of many to them ; the first was the' large number of North, Carolinians who died, numbering generally nearly, if not quite half of the whole number — a fact I turn over to Mr. Gradgrind, "without note or comment ; " the second, the entire absence of deaths from intermittent feVer, or any similar complaint. Now, I knew well that many of the sick died from this and kindred diseases produced by the miasma of the stagnant lake in our camp, but the reports which I consolidated every morning, contained no reference to them. I enquired at the Dispensary, where the reports were first handed in the cause of this anomaly, and learned that Dr. Sanger would sign no report, which ascribed to any of these diseases, the death of the patient !

As soon as the distant meshes of the political web began to vibrate, the master spinner made his appear ance from the recesses of Coro, and the reports of his erratic movements, now to Maracaibo, now to San Felipe, now to Barquismieto, ceased. It was a bright hot forenoon hi the first week of Sep tember when, as I was lazdy swinging in my hammock in the Calle de Constitucion at Valencia, the unusual sound of martial music reached my ear. Starting up, I hurried to the Gran Plaza, and was hi time to see the Venezuelan army enter. Shades of Brion and Bolivar ! what an armp it was ! I have seen troops of all nations, civilised and un civilised, from China to Peru, but never any like those. Some of the officers, indeed, were tad and well-made ; but the men were the strangest figures — lean old scarecrows and starveling boys not five feet high, the greater number half naked, with huge strips of raw beef twisted round then hats or hanging from then- belts. Then- skins seemed to have been baked black with exposure to the sun, and then arms and accoutrements were of the most wretched description. Yet they were not contemptible — far from it — but rather wend, repulsive — a sight to make one shudder. My first thought on seeing them was, " What could want, miasma, exposure, or fatigue do to hann these animated skeletons ? Could anything make them blacker, grimmer, more fleshless, more miserable ?

For three months of excessive caution, these heroic men had fought their way up to Avithin four miles of Richmond, during which the Confederates had every opportunity to rally all their men, and prepare for the conflict ; and they had used it with the utmost industry and skill. After one continuous battle, lasting seven days, during which they had suffered in credible hardships, amid the carnage of battle-fields and the mire and miasma of the swamps, and seen more than fifteen thousand of their brave comrades slaughtered, Avounded, or captured, they had at length wrenched victory from the grasp of their deadly enemies, and Avere yet eighty-six thou sand men of unfaltering courage and unconquerable prowess; but they Avere noAV to leave their fields of heroic daring in disgrace !

Foot by foot we steadily approached, till but thirty-five paces intervened, when, each aiming low, our two right-hand barrels responded to the pressure on the trigger, cutting a lane through the unconscious broad-bills, and as they rose off the water almost with the voice of thunder, each left-hand barrel repeated the performance, bringing down, in ad attitudes, maimed and wounded. Over thirty birds fed to this fusilade, and among their numbers was to be found almost every variety, from the handsome-plumaged widgeon and teal to the larger maUard. Except on American prairies, in autumn and spring, at the periods of migration, I know of no place where such fine duck-shooting can be obtained as here; but the preference, even if the numbers should be much less, must be given to America, for few of our race can continue to breathe the noxious miasmas that night and morning arise from the paddy-fields, without his constitution and health becoming seriously impaired. In fact, two of the gentlemen who then shot with me found premature graves, and, in each instance, their medical attendants affirmed that they had contracted the disease which had deprived them of life through their too frequent trips in pursuit of their favourite sport. Our work commenced successfully, and how often does a good delmt tend to make us continue to perform well! Both shot better than usual, and it soon appeared that

There is no harvest home, no thanksgiving when all is safely gathered in, only the visit of the tax-collector, whose rapacity is not satisfied until he is sure he has not left the Fellah anything beyond a bare subsistence in return for his year of hard work. All through the summer irrigation must be carried on, but in Upper Egypt a large acreage is alloAved to lie fallow ; hence the finer crops of wheat. Only a portion near the river bank is cultivated for the melons and cucumbers which form the staple diet of the Arabs during the hot season. Perhaps June is the most unhealthy month, as it is that in Avhich the river is at its lowest, and when the smells, always bad, are at their worst. But soon the tropical rains in Central Africa begin to swell the stream thousands of miles beloAv ; the rapid flow carries away the miasma that had begun to affect the usually healthy population, and the ever-recurring question again arises, whether there will be a "good Nile." Before Heliopolis is reached, a great palace, that of Choobra, is passed. Here Towfik, the Khedive's eldest son, generally resides. He has a good name among the people in comparison with his brothers : but it may be accounted for by remembering that H 2

And again a little farther south, poor Winwoode Reade laboured, and farther on still Clapper ton, Denham, and Lander. Yes, Africa has taken many, will still have more, and yet not be satisfied. That west coast is a hard, cruel country to the Anglo-Saxon. Could you navigate some of its bayous or creeks, thread your passage through the intricate mangrove swamps, see the giant hideous crocodile reposing on mud-banks reeking with fever and miasma, you would at once say it is no place for the white man. True, it is not ; and although I once craved to be an explorer there, the task must now pass to younger hands — less able, certainly, to be spared, and more capable of bearing the brunt.

The "City", fronted by a wide white sand beach, and with its houses mixed up with vegetation, amongst which are some fine cocoa-nut palms, looks well enough from the water — quite inviting, in fact ; but when once you enter its streets, all its charms are destroyed by the air of neglect and decay, which hangs about the place like a deadly miasma. It was a beautiful Sunday evening when we dropped anchor off the place ; and one would have thought the arrival of a steamer in the port was not such an every-day event as to be regarded with indifference. But such was the case, no one seeming to take any interest in our coming, save a knot of four or five people who stood at a street corner. We landed at dusk, and walking up to the group, inquired of a grey-headed individual the way to the house of the Judge of the district, to whom we had a letter. The old gent, who answered our questions in a peculiarly weak and raspy voice, kindly showed us the way himself. Crossing an open square, all grass-grown and deserted, we arrived at a row of better built houses, and were shown into one of them as being "the house of the Judge." Presently we were intro duced to the Judge himself, a little, old, half negro looking man, having the lid of one eye held open by a strip of sticking-plaster between it and the eyebrow. This naturally gave that eye a glassy stare, as it could never be winked. He complained of being ill, and was evidently rheumatic, for when he tried to walk he brought himself up with a hitch, as if his legs had suddenly kinked.

The climate of West Austrada is generally admitted to be one of the finest known. It is very dry, though with a rainfad of about 3 0 inches annually, and the heat is rarely oppressive. The sterdity of the country generally, and the prevalence of sand, is highly favourable to health, as there is little luxuriant vegetation to produce miasma by its decomposition, and hardly any morasses or damp lowlands to breed ague and fever. The mortality of the whole colony is said to have averaged only one per cent since its formation, that of Great Britain being about two and a half per cent. The wet season is from Aprd to September, but during this period there is much bright, clear weather. The rest of the year is dry, but with occasional showers and thunderstorms. During three months hot land winds occur, but they are neither so frequent nor so severe as in the southern and eastern colonies, whde the great droughts and heavy floods so prevalent elsewhere are almost unknown in West Austrada. Snow is unknown, and ice is only seen in the morning and in the depth of winter. With these excellent qualities the praise bestowed on it by a writer in the Calcutta Englishman may not be exaggerated — that it is a climate " such as no other in the world can excel, and few equal, for comfort and health-giving attributes." As has been already stated in our chapter on the Natural History of Australia, this colony possesses many striking peculiarities in its flora and fauna. Sir Joseph Hooker, in his Essay on the Flora of Australia gives many interesting detads on this subject, which we may here briefly summarise. In South-Western Austrada there

At every step we take away from the city, the rich beauty of the Algerian vegetation attracts us more and more. " What strikes those who come to Algiers for the first time, is the dark green vegetation. This vert sombre is conspicuous throughout the three provinces, even in winter. The flower-grown grass, which is spread like a variegated carpet over the land, wherever the invading growth of trees allows patches of the ground to be seen, is almost as deep in tint as the foliage of a northern wood." — Algeria as It Is. The whole of this road is bordered with eucalyptus, an Australian tree introduced into Algeria by the patriotic exertions of Messrs. Rammell, Cordier, and Trottier, to whom the country owes a large debt of gratitude, since this tree, from its peculiar power of absorbing miasma, has proved, and in its further cultivation is likely to prove, a most invaluable agent in rendering healthy, tracts of country which would otherwise be unfit for colonization. The eucalyptus, which is surely destined to play an im portant part in future schemes of colonization in various parts of the world, is of the myrtle tribe. There are said to be no fewer than one hundred and fifty species of the tree — two kinds, the red-gum resinifera and the blue-gum globulus, having been chiefly and most successfully cultivated in Algeria. The blossom is like a shower of snow. The tree has an extraordinarily rapid growth, an increase of six to nine feet yearly being by no means uncommon, and it attains an enormous height. The introduction of the eucalyptus into Algeria dates

To John Gerar, William DeBrahm, his Majesty's Surveyor General for the Southern District of North America, who in 1757 erected a fort at Ebenezer, are we indebted for an accurate plan of that town.t As the village increased, this plan was ex tended ; — its distinctive characteristics being retained. From contemporaneous notices we learn that New Ebenezer, within a short time after its settlement, gave manifest token of substantial growth and prosperity. The houses there erected were larger and more comfortable than those which had been built in the old town. Gardens and farms were cleared, enclosed, and brought under creditable cultivation, and the sedate, religious inhabitants enjoyed the fruits of their industry and economy. Funds received from Germany for that purpose were employed in the erection of an Orphan House, in which, for lack of a Church, the community worshipped for several years. We presume the account of the condition of Ebenezer in 1738-9, furnished by Benjamin Martyn,| is as interesting and reliable as any that can be suggested. It is as follows : " Fifteen miles from Purysburg on the Georgia side, is Ebe nezer, where the Saltzburghers are situated ; their Houses are * Strobel's Saltzburgers and their Descendants, p. 91.

The plains became green with tender grass, the great cloud- banks rose behind the hills, and I awoke one morning to hear, to my dismay, the croaking of frogs close to the camp. With the experience of one more year, we should at once have moved to higher ground. We stayed how ever where we were, and suffered in consequence. The climate of Jericho must have altered greatly since Josephus described the place as " a region fit for gods." Thrice we visited the Jordan Valley; three times the terrible remittent fever of Jericho threatened valuable lives in our party, and once it proved fatal. The change of climate is due, I imagine, to the decay of cultivation. Herod planted palm-groves, and watered them by aque ducts still remaining. The groves existed in the seventh, and even in the twelfth century; but now only two trees can be found. The Crusaders also undertook cultivation, and made sugar at the ruined mills under Quarantania, still called the "sugar-mills." At the present day the land is quite as productive as ever ; but the Arabs disdain agriculture, and the inhabitants of Eriha are so enervated, by the climate, that they bring men down from the hills to reap their scanty crops. Every kind of vegetable will grow here — tomatoes, vegetable marrows, grapes and indigo ; yet the

On the 4th of December the fever found us out. On the 2nd, Drake had over-fatigued him self in paying a visit to the Kelt monastery ; on the 3rd I had ridden up to Jerusalem, to make preparations for our proposed winter in the valley; on the 4th I started again sot camp late in the afternoon. The way lay along the well-known road to Jericho, round the chalky hill to the little stone village of Bethany, where the ruined Crusading tower, so quaintly named by mediæval writers " the Castle of St. Lazarus," dominates the more modern buildings. Thence the road leads by certain rock-cut tombs, one of which per chance is the very sepulchre whence Lazarus was called back to life, and soon after it dives down into a valley between barren hills, and passes the traditional Apostles' Fountain. There is nothing remarkable after this until one arrives at a small plain, and ascends to where the strong fort, once called the Castle of the Good Sama ritan, commands the pass above a ruined Khan ; this place is still called by the old Bible name, " The going up of blood," due to the red colour of the marl all round the hill. A very steep descent leads down on the east from the castle, and soon after a long view opens out of countless

The climate has, however, to all appearance materially changed for the worse. The plains of Jericho are no longer a " region fit for gods," and the climate of the maritime plains, in autumn, is little less than deadly ; but this Avould indicate, not a decrease, but, if anything, an increase, in the amount of rain, as the miasma is due to stagnant Avater collecting in marshes and pools. The main cause of the malarious nature of the climate, seems to be the neglect of proper drainage. The splendid Avorks of the Romans are in ruins ; the great rock cuttings, Avhich let out to the sea the Avater noAv soaking in the marshes of Sharon, are filled up Avith earth ; Herod's aqueducts, which irrigated the plains of Jericho, are destroyed, and no attempt is ever made to enforce sanitary regulations, or to promote public drainage or irrigation works. Turning next to the question of the decrease of timber, it is important first to obtain a clear idea of the character of the old vegetation described in the Bible. It will then appear that the change is not one of kind, but only of degree.

Sleeping in these forests is very unhealthy. There is a most fatal miasma all through the year, less during the hot months, but very bad during and immediately after the annual rains ; and in September and October nearly every soul in the jungly tracts is smitten with fever. The vapour only rises to a certain height above the ground, and at the elevation of ten feet or so, I believe one could sleep in the jungles with impunity ; but it is dangerous at all times to sleep in the forest, unless at a considerable elevation. The absence of all those delicious smells which make a w7alk through the woodlands at home so delightful, is con spicuous in the sal forests, and another of the most noticeable features is the extreme silence, the oppressive stillness that reigns. You know how full of melody is an English wood, when thrush, blackbird, mavis, linnet, and a thousand warblers flit from tree to tree. How the choir rings out its full anthem of sweetest sound, till every bush and tree seems a centre of sweet strains, soft, low, liquid trills, and full ripe gushes of melody and song. But it is not thus in an Indian forest. There are actually few birds. As you brush through the long grass and trample the tangled undergrowth, putting aside the sprawling branches, or dodging- under the pliant arms of the creepers, you may flush a black or grey partridge, raise a covey of quail, or startle a quiet family party of peafowl, but there are no sweet singers flitting about to make the vaulted arcades of the forest echo to their music.

The disease seized a man in various ways, — sometimes beginning with drowsiness, succeeded by racking pains, followed by high fever, complete dilatation of the eyeballs, and death. In other cases it resembled jaundice, begin ning with vomiting, but ending in muttered delirium and a low typhoid state, from which the patients but seldom recovered. In two or three cases the men died suddenly, after a few days' restlessness, want of energy, and appetite. Seventy miles to our rear, in the Croc odile River valley, whole families were swept away by this fatal scourge, which continued increasing in sever ity till the 18th May, after which there were no more new cases. Arsenic, in heroic doses, with cinchona bark, was found to be the only reliable remedy in the low stages of the disease. At one time, of sixty-four duty-men thirty-two were ill. Of course the loss of life was considerable. The death-rate seemed to be ut terly unaffected by the previous habits of the patients ; and drinkers and weakly worn-out men went off no quicker than did fine fellows in good condition, who had never drank spirits, or committed reprehensible excesses, in their lives. New-comers who had arrived during the summer wrere much more liable to an attack than those even partially inured to the climate.

We see the equal distribution of God's blessings in all things and everywhere. In the tropics, beneath the gorgeous flower that lades the passing zephyr with its fragrance, lurks the most venomous reptile. The bird of sweetest song and most brilliant plumage sports upon the shrub that exhales the deadliest poison. So here, in this mountain-girt region, where, to some ex tent, the people are denied some of the higher order of luxuries, the earth is pregnant with all that is absolutely necessary to their comfort and prosperity. If they cannot pluck oranges and pineapples, they are not subject to the miasmas of the everglades — if they cannot feast upon melons and oysters, they have not the chills and fevers of the seaboard. But to the subject. The Saltworks are sixteen miles northeast of Abingdon, and so near the line dividing the counties of Washington and Smyth, that the two prin cipal wells, one in each county, are not more than twenty paces apart. These Saltworks are situated in an exceed ingly fertile valley, embracing some three hundred acres, entirely surrounded by hills — some of them very high aud precipitous. They form a natural amphitheatre, and from innumerable indications, this valley, or hopper-like depres sion in the hills, is supposed to have been a lake at some period in the world's history. Some thirty-eight years ago the writer was acquainted with several aged persons who had known the place anterior to the discovery of the subterranean saline stream from which the salt is now

From this chain of heights, the streams supplying the two rivers which, diverging to the east and west respectively, watered the plain, all descend. Olympus, too, was clothed with magnificent forests of oak and pine, while rich veins of copper and other metals were found in the mountain recesses. The plain was a rich expanse of woodland, pasture and cultivated land, with many a town and village, of which now only a few scattered heaps remain, hardly worth the name of ruins.

It is no longer silent and deserted ; canoes come every day, with Indians and half-breeds ; many with their families, and household utensils for a three months' campaign in the woods. They come from Obidos, Alenquer, Santarem, even Prainha and Itaituba, two or three hundred miles away. Tiny, palm-thatched huts are built along the banks, and hammocks are swung to the trees ; every day the woods are traversed by the nut-gatherers ; every night the shores are lighted by their fires. It is not an easy life : tramping through many miles of the thick forest, they must bring in their day's gathering — sixty or eighty pounds, perhaps — on their backs. They are content to breakfast and sup on a bit offish and a little man dioca-meal ; even these sometimes fail them, for the improv ident people do not care to burden themselves with a large stock of provisions ; besides, their forest-work leaves them little time to fish and prepare food, and the wet season is always the time of scarcity. It is the time of fever and weakness, too. The Curua village is healthy enough ; but far up the river, by the rapids and along the narrow side streams, the air is full of miasma ; the forests are reeking

The nut-gatherers about the Igarape Branco are almost sure to have attacks of ague or pernicious fever, but notwith standing all our exposure here, none of the party were any the worse for it. When we finally returned to Curua, a week later, every man was in good health and spirits : Joao came to me voluntarily, and proposed that we should go to the falls with a light canoe ; and the other men would have ac companied me willingly. Among the Indians, especially, I have found that when a workman is well treated he will go to the end of the earth with his employer ; only, in a bad situation, he is likely to desert, just as a child will run away from danger. On a difficult canoe-voyage it is better to be familiar with the crew, and allow them to regard you, in some measure, as one of them, but without sacrificing a proper dignity ; then they may refuse to go farther, but they will never desert you without warning. Before leaving this region, let us review the geography of the river and its valley. The Curua, in all probability, takes its rise on the southern slope of the Guiana mountains, some where about lat. i° or i° 30', N., and long. 550 W. G. ; it flows, approximately, south. As far as lat. i° S. it is much obstructed by rapids and falls ; from the Cachoeirinha down, there are no obstructions except sand-banks, and the river would be navigable for steamboats during the flood season. This navigable portion is about eighty miles long, with all its curves ; but a straight line from the falls to Lake Curua, would hardly measure more than fifty-five miles ; the gen eral course, in this portion, is south-southwest. The only tributaries of any importance are the Igarap6 Branco, from the east, near the falls, and the Mamia, from the west, thirty

The swampy nature of the soil for ten months of the year, the exhalations from the luxuriant vegetation and animal matter, fill the air with miasma, which the human constitution cannot with stand. Only the despised and unhappy race of the Molunghies, salt-makers, who are lower than the pariahs, are condemned to live in the islands of the Sunderbunds. or to fall a prey to wild beasts. The life of these people is, perhaps, the most melancholy on earth. Con demned to their occupation by their caste, they cannot escape it, the son must succeed his father in it. They cannot even save themselves by flight, for whenever escape is not rendered impossible by forests or impass able morasses, guards are placed to intercept it on the sandy tongues of land, stretching far into the sea, on which the Molunghies boil the crystals left by the in crustations of the retreating sea water in large salt pans. Defenceless as they are, at the sight of the tiger lurking among the reeds, they fly to their caves dug in the sand, from which, however, the bloodthirsty beast not seldom drags forth his victim, though he generally attacks his prey from some safe ambush. To such cruel subjection, avarice and religious de lusions are capable of condemning a whole race of men.

The internal appointments of the bungalow con sisted of a table and two chairs, a great advance on the universal custom of squatting cross-legged on the floor. The town lies beneath the shade of lofty cocoa nut and areca palms, and is surrounded by luxuriant rice fields ; the houses are quite concealed among the foliage of giant plantains. It would scarcely be a healthy place if it were not that it is kept cool, and all miasma blown away by the breezes alternating be tween the mountains and the sea. Helfer resolved to make some stay here both in order to explore the neighbourhood and to recruit our health ; for although our strength had held out hitherto, now that the excitement was over we felt greatly ex hausted and overdone. I especially required much rest, but my husband soon began to make excursions again. The 24th of December, the eve when we celebrate our beloved Christmas festival, was approaching, and we wished to observe it as usual. But of what use was it to adorn and light up a tree when Nature is clad in all her verdure and beauty, when the sun Avould obscure the tapers, and even the moonfigfit rival their brightness. Amidst such surroundings, a Christmas tree must look rather like a caricature than a symbol of festiVity. To make it appropriate the earth should be wrapped in frost and snow, and the windows frosted with floral designs ; our thoughts as well as our eyes are then directed to the Avorld Avithin rather than to

In this controversy the authorities of Georgia were clearly in the right, and in all probability the President would not have been sustained by Congress had he persisted in his course. On the 31st of May, 1830, an act was passed by Con gress, which received the approval of President Jackson, providing for the removal of the Indian tribes that lived east ofthe Mississippi River to a portion of country lying west of that river. Under this act the Cherokee Indians, who occupied some of the finest lands in northern Georgia, were removed to the Indian Territory, where new homes were assigned them. The Seminole Indians of Florida refused to leave their homes, and in 1835 began a war which lasted until 1842, when they were brought to terms by the capture of their chief, Osceola, and their crushing defeat by General Zachary Taylor at the head of Lake Okeechobee. The Georgia volunteers bore a prominent part in this harassing war, where the miasma of the Everglades was more destructive to life than the weapons of the Seminoles. In the Mexican war, which broke out May 8, 1846, and ended May 30, 1848, the sons of Georgia were among the foremost in responding to the call of their country, and were distinguished for the fidelity with which they performed the various duties assigned to them. Some of the most distinguished of the officers in the regular army of the United States during that war were from Georgia. In the lamentable war which arose between the North ern and Southern States of the Union in 1861, Georgia took a very prominent part. An Ordinance of Secession was adopted on the 19th of January, 1861, by a conven tion of delegates, representing every part of the State, which met in the capitol at Milledgeville. During the

A strip of grass divides the road in many places from a stagnant ditch ; and along this I walked, whenever it was possible, in order to cool my feet. Every step that I took flushed the frogs in twos and threes, like pheasants in a warm corner of a cover ; up they got, little and big, baby squeakers and patriarchal croakers, taking a hop and a header into the stinking water. Another species (R. alpina), with a brown back and bright orange belly, frequents the mountain tarns. It is found abundantly in the Todtensee (7090 feet), on the Grimsel Pass, and in the Oberalpsee (6663 feet), and is said to be even more delicate in flavour than the next species. The green or edible frog (R. esculenta) is also not uncommon, at any rate in Switzerland ; but I believe it does not range so high as the last-named species ; while the beautiful little tree frog (Hyla arborea) is rarely seen beyond the lower slopes. I have found it in the bushes on the verge of the Lake of Geneva. According to Tschudi there are three species of toads, be sides the one common to England (Bufo vulgaris). Only the last-named, or a variety (which some have made a separate species under the name of B. alpinus), ascends to any great height : this has been found up to about 6000 feet. A flat-headed slimy black lizard may sometimes be seen sluggishly crawling about, especially in damp places on the mountains, which is evidently very different to the newts and lizards familiar to most English. This is the salamander (Sala mandra), first cousin to the peculiarly ugly creature from Japan, wliich was, if it is not still, to be seen in one of the reptile-cases in the Zoological Gardens (London). There appear to be two varieties in the Alps. One (S. maculosa) marked with orange spots on the flank and belly ; the other (S. atra), which is all black ; and the latter is said to have a much higher range than the former. I have seen it in most parts of the Alps ; the

A cold, drizzling rain continued to descend for several days, and our camp became a fair specimen of "Virginia mud." I began to feel the effects of the miasma which came floating on overy breeze from the adjacent swamps and marshes, and fever and ague became my daily companions for a time. As I sat in my tent, roasting or shivering as the case might be, I took a strange pleasure in watch ing the long trains of six mule teams which were constantly passing and repassing within a few rods of my tent. As "Miss PeriAvinkle" remarks, there are several classes of mules. "The coquettish mule has small feet, a nicely trimmed tail, perked up ears, and seems much giA*en to little tosses of the head, affected skips and prances, and, if he Avears bells or streamers, puts on as many airs as any belle.

The soil of contiguous lands, north and east, is a rich sandy loam, of exceeding fineness and perfect drainage, unsurpassed for flowers and fruits, and garden vegetables ; south and west across the Little Kanawha, a soil of clay is found, cultivated with less facility, but productive when properly managed, and very durable. The variety of surface, riverward slope, and predominent character of soil, forbid the accumulation of water to stagnate and breed miasma, and explain the prevalent healthfulness of the whole region, and its especial exemption from malarious diseases. The streets are regularly laid out, sixty feet wide, in squares of three hundred and forty feet, with few exceptions, graded and gravelled. Two rivers afford ample wharfage for the rapidly accumulating trans portation business. The south branch of the Balti more and Ohio Railroad opens rapid communication through the State, and turnpikes lead towards Win chester, Staunton, Charleston, , Elizabeth, and St. Mary's.

In their efforts to arrest infanticide and propagate their faith they brave danger and death in a thousand forms ; fearing not even the miasma arising from the malaria districts, wdiich has hitherto successfully deterred all foreign attempts to obtain possession of this valuable island. Their success cries aloud to all Christian denominations — " Go thou and do likewise." From time to time the Hova Government makes raids on the Sackalave settlements in this district ; the last attempt is reported by Pere Jean, in a letter addressed by him from the Island of Reunion to MM. les Directeurs de l'Œuvre de la Propagation de la Foi, in which he states that — "On the 5th of August, 1853, the Hovas attacked the Sackalaves, both by sea and by land ; but their dhows and a three-masted American vessel, which was freighted by them, and started from the Hova settlement at Mazangaie, having 400 men and some cannon embarked on board of her, tacked ship on perceiving the French brig of war, Le Victor, at anchor off Bali."*" Menabe comprehends all the territory included between the river Douko, on the North ; the mountain chain called Bongou Lava, or Long Mountain, on the East ; the • " Annales de la Propagation de la Foi," No. 159, Mars, 1855.

Sulina itself is a mere collection of huts and sheds huddled together on what is really nothing better than a mud bank. The inhabitants are fever-and-poverty-stricken, and the heavy, hazy atmosphere is too sure an indication of the miasma continually prevailing. On issuing into the Black Sea, the numerous timbers stick ing up in the sands on the coast on both sides of the mouth of the river demonstrate clearly the frequency of wrecks upon this deceitful coast, and the water discoloured for miles out to sea by the alluvium brought down by the current, shows that the process of filling up is still going on at a rapid rate. Mud banks covered with reeds and thick brick coloured water extend to the horizon on all sides. In short, a more forlorn prospect than the Sulina mouth of the Danube can scarcely be imagined. Until lately every vessel on leaving Galatz was obliged to drag a heavy rake after her on her downward course, to loosen the mud at the bottom, and allow it to be carried away by the current ; but of late years this habit has been discontinued, and the rake has been superseded by dredges. We arrived at Odessa after a smooth voyage of some six teen hours, passing, shortly before entering the harbour, the cliffs on which the unfortunate " Tiger" ran aground. The town looked very imposing from the sea, situated as it is on overhanging rocks. The rows of white houses and terraces were very grateful to our eyes after the scenes we had just passed through, and the sight of numbers of people walking and driving struck us the more from the previous desola tion. We here bade adieu to our mu-ical friends, hearing, with much regret, that the greater part of the luggage of the

TEMPERATURE. The local temperature of Palestine is greatly affected by the physical division of the country into the four long and narrow parallel tracts or strips of territory, of different eleva tion, which have been already described.3 The western plain rises but slightly above the level of the Mediterranean ; while the Ghor, or valley of the Jordan, is depressed several hun dred feet below the same. The western hill-country around Jerusalem and Hebron is elevated two thousand five hundred and two thousand seven hundred feet above the sea ; while the hill-country east of Jordan, which reaches an elevation of three thousand feet around Kerak and in the Belka, rises to five thousand feet in the mountains of 'Ajlun. The dif ference of level between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, is about three thousand nine hundred feet, or very nearly three fourths of a mile. Western Hill- Country. The climate of Jerusalem is in general cool and pleasant ; and is never oppressively warm, except during the continuance of a Sirocco or south wind.

There is no doubt, therefore, that a great deal of sick ness was experienced by passengers crossing the Isthmus previously to the year 1855 ; and hence, I take it, was the origin of " Panama fever." Dampier teds us that gentlemen that came from Peru to Panama, especially in the months of Jeme, July, and August, " cut their hair close, to preserve them from fever, for the place was sickly to them, as they caene out of a country which never hath any rains, but enjoys a constant serenity ;" but even he " was apt to believe the city is healthy enough to other people." Happily for the traveller, this cause of sickness is all over now. The passenger of to-day as safely makes the transit of the Isthmus, as he may visit any tropical country ; and unless one particularly wishes to keep his head cool, there is no reason or advantage in his adopting the apparent former practice of the Peruvians, of " cutting his hair close to preserve him from fevers." The year here is divided into two seasons. The rainy, which coenmences about the middle of April, and lasts untd the middle of December ; and the dry, which extends over the remaining four months. The thermometer (Fahrenheit) ranges in Panama from 72* to 92°, but these are two extreme points, and are very seldom attained, the average being between 78° and

THE wrell-tilled fields which extend around the tree-shaded village of Marengo combine, with its clean white cottages, to give it now a very cheerful and flourishing look ; but what its past has been, may be best narrated in the words of the civil, intelligent landlady of the inn where we passed the night. ' My husband, myself, and three young children, formed part of a band of 850 colonists, who were sent by Government in 1848,* to establish an * In 1848 the National Assembly votedfifty millions of francs in furtherance of the colonisation of Algeria. The depression of trade at that period made the idea of emigration thoroughly popular with the needy working classes of Paris. Bankrupt shopkeepers, tailors, shoemakers, jewellers, watchmakers, musicians, and artists, and tradespeople of various kinds, composed the band of 13,500 emi grants who, consequent on the Assembly's vote, were sent in succes sive detachments to Algiers. Revelling in the idea of having a house, land, cattle, agricultural implements free of cost, and a daily ration of food for the period of three years, the colonists landed on the Algerian shores amidst dances, songs, and shouts. But once drafted to the interior, to live in wooden huts amidst a waste of brush wood, in an atmosphere laden with miasma, and utterly unfitted for

Two-thirds of the entire people disappeared from British Kaffraria in the first seven months of 1857. The population of Kaffraria proper underwent even greater diminution. Upwards of thirty thousand Kaffirs entered service in the colony, some thousands took refuge with other tribes, and some thousands perished from want. The military organization of the Kaffirs was thus broken up, and the influence of their chiefs was in a large measure dissipated. Their herds and flocks being gone, they had to become inured to systematic labour in the fields or in the towns. It is not im probable that they will now form an important element in the industrial life, and contribute largely to the prosperity, of the colony. At any rate, the constant menace of a native war, wdiich formerly hung like a dark storm-cloud over the settlements, has passed away. The extended exploration of Africa, and the im portant experiments wliich have lately been made to test its productive resources, raise well-founded hopes of a magnificent future for this great continent. Till just the other day the vast interior remained, as it had been for centuries, a hidden land, from the investigation of which travellers were deterred by miasma on the sea-board, and the wide tracts of sandy desert which stretched further inland.

A strong central power is absolutely necessary to fix the civil and military administrations on a pure and firm basis ; to introduce a good system of legislation, and especially of taxation ; to restore the national credit ; and, in general, to put the institutions of the country in such a channel that the progress and welfare of the people might be their result. If Otho had only been an intelligent despot, he might have accomplished this in the early years of his reign. The constitution which succeeded would then have included all the elements necessary for the prosperity of a people. The misfortune of Greece is, as the eminent historian of purity of Greek honour, and prevent the moral and material progress of the nation. Put a strong bridle on selfish and ambitious passions ; repulse from you that ignoble sloth, which causes the very soil to protest against the unproductiveness which is imposed on it. Restore harmony to the strings of society. Temper our disorderly liberty by a legal rigour. ' Two centuries ago Fra Paolo Sarpi wished to teach the Venetians the surest manner of maintaining their sovereignty over Greece, and recommended, Pane e bastonate ! The demagogues of Athens, Sire, are worthy of being controlled by like means. ' Postpone then, Sire, until a happier time, your benevolent intentions. Crush under your feet the vermin who are devouring the public wealth. Imitate Cavaignac. Do not hesitate at imprisonment ; apply a remedy to the cancrous sores ofthe country; purify her political atmosphere from its miasma of corrupted incense. Demagogues and adventurers will loudly cry against you, but they are only the tail, and not the head, of the nation.' This article was read by the democratic factions in Athens with the fiercest rage, and several copies containing it were publicly burned in the clubs and cafes. Some such policy, however, as the writer recommends must be put in force before social order can ever be restored in Greece.

Once the Campagna was a fertile plain, covered with thrifty hamlets, whose inhabitants basked in the fulness of prosperity ; but with the long procession of ages, instead of increased pros- perity have come fire, famine, and slaughter, and now only a desert is left. The cause of the plague which now ravages it is uncertain. By some it is attributed to the great stagnant pools of water which, in times past, has flowed, and in some cases still flows from broken aqueducts upon the land, and finds no outlet. By others it is supposed to arise from the decayed remains, both animal and vege- table, which have accumulated here for ages, and impregnated the very earth with disease. This trouble is daily increasing. The only means of diminishing it is universally allowed to be by ploughing the land, draining it, and cultivating it assiduously. Thus the pernicious influence would gradually escape from the soil, and the district would again become habitable, as in the days of ancient Rome. But this is not the course pursued by Prince Torlonia and the other great proprietors. These are continually buying additional farms and vineyards, which are destroyed, the barns and granaries pulled down, the fruit-trees and vines rooted up, and all is changed to pasturage, over which the miasma and herds of lowering, shaggy, ferocious buffaloes roam uncontrolled.

Our preventive measures must not, however, pause here. Much wib have been done when we have learnt how to arrest the progress of future pauperism and crime in the young persons who are actuaby in our hands.

The very existence of this class may be unknown to the upper aud middle portion of society, as they are to be found in parts of the great cities unfrequented by respectable persons; but they may be seen in large numbers when a great exciting cause arises, whether a mob, or a trial of some of their associates, or an execution (a scene which shoibd inspire a sickening horror into any person of common humanity), when their wild yebs and heartless demeanour reveal the worse than heathen bar-

Shall I show you a rock of severe grandeur, towering a thousand feet above a river of unsurpassed beauty, and crowned with a grim old ruin, marvellously picturesque and appropriate to the scene ; — and shall I attempt to improve the picture by describing the pure rapes and the gallant murders which those walls have seen ?

The third great Error — the fatal Error — was in the French General granting a Truce of twenty-four Hours. That Truce saved the City. It was highly impolitic, when a sudden Impression was desired; but it was almost culpable, when the American General was not present, but was hourly expected, to concede such a Priviledge without his approval. D'Estaing was too much flushed with the Victo ries of Grenada and St. Vincents to be cautious. Lincoln had been too long schooled in Disasters not to be wary and vigilant. " The English Officers themselves acknowledged that had the combined Armies marched to Savannah at their first Junction, they could easily have taken it ; so poorly defensible was it at the Beginning of the Siege. The Ignorance of their Guides, and the Betrayal of their Plan of Attack, completed the Series of Misfortunes which resulted in their Overthrow. "The Season of the Year, both for Land and Sea Operations, was the most improper which could have been chosen. Who, that is at all acquainted with our Coast, does not know its pecu liar Exposure to the equinoctial Gales of September? And who, that knows our Climate, is not aware of the almost certain Sickness which, during our Fall Months, attacks the Stranger, particularly at that Period, when camping near Swamps and Ditches ? The consequence was, that the French Officers and Troops, both at Sea and on Land, were continually anxious, restive, longing to depart; fearing the Miasma on Shore and the Hurricane on the Ocean. Both came to them too soon; but the Destruction of neither equalled the Carnage of the Battle. There was a vauntingness at times in the Language of d'Estaing,

He was one of the three engineer officers present at the battle of Williams burg, accompanied Captain Stewart in his reconnois sances which discovered the enemy's unoccupied re doubts, and led General Hancock's brigade thereto. He was sent back to the Commanding; General in the evening with the colors captured. With the advanced guard of General Stoneman, and subsequently in the various engineer works and duties on the right bank of the Chickahominy, he was daring and indefatigable. 1st Lieutenant (now Captain) H. L. Abbot, Topo graphical Engineers, was attached to my person through out the campaign as an aide. His services were par ticularly noticeable during the siege of Yorktown, by his valuable reconnoissances, and by his skill in com bining the information gained by others into maps of the works, and of the topography of the ground. During the march to the Chickahominy, and while the amry was encamped on the river, his time was princi pally occupied in making up the map of the country", founded on the reconnoissances of the officers of both Eno-ineer corps and others, in which duty he was under the immediate direction of Brigadier-General Hum phreys. His health, which had suffered from the miasma of the Potomac, while serving on the defences of Wash ington, was further impaired at Yorktown and on the Chickahominy, and he was unable to bear much physical labor or exposure. After reaching the James River he was compelled to leave the army by an illness which pros trated him for two months, during which time however he superintended the preparation of the " Campaign Maps."

They will cultivate the hills as long as they can irri gate them, and if they are too dry they will use them as burial-places, but live on them never. They in variably settle down in the middle of their rice-grounds, but as invariably surround their villages by thick, and sometimes impervious groves of bamboo ; or in the case of a town, by a wall higher than the tops of the houses inside. The insidious miasma will roll and wreath itself up the hill-sides ; but I think I am right in saying it will never descend again after topping the wall, nor will it penetrate the bamboo shield raised to ward off its approach. I think I should be supported by our medical officers, when I say that in winter, when the country was dry, the troops quartered on the top of Magazine Hill, in Canton, were healthy ; but in the summer, when the water was out over the paddy-fields, those quartered in the centre of the town had the best of it. Look again at our occupation of Chusan in the old China war, with the lamentable loss of life which occurred there. It is true, I believe, that the salt meat brought from Calcutta, and which, for want of fresh supplies, they were forced to eat, was bad ; but men were encamped on the heights, and I attribute much of the sickness to that cause. I went to Chusan before its occupation in 1860, and looked at those heights, and in the broad sunlight very pleasant places they appeared ; but wait till evening, when the enemy is visible, and watch the insidious white vapour rising and spreading, and dealing out fever and ague by the hospital-full. But setting aside the hygienic part of the question, these nestling villages form a very pleasing feature in

Here indeed nature showers down her choicest bounties : no fogs, miasmas, or even hurtful dews ; atmosphere almost always translucent and bright ; the thermometer in winter scarcely ever falling below 60 degrees; and where, during the hot summer months, a cool and comfortable retreat, of almost any temperature, may be found up the mountains. Lastly, there are no poisonous reptiles, merely a brown lizard, harmless to everything save the vines; frogs are quite a recent importation ; and so far as I could learn, there are none of that numerous tribe of annoying insects which infest the tropical regions, only the familiar household flea, that makes himself at home everywhere. Unfortunately, the dependence of the population and the staple of Madeira has been its vines, whose produce this year, as well as last, has totally failed, from some cause almost as inscrutable, or at least as incurable, and in its consequences nearly as cala- mitous, on a small scale, as the potato rot in isles nearer home. I could not have believed without seeing it : — in every direction the grapes were withered up like parched peas, and, in many cases, the trees themselves dying. .Such an extraordinary visi- tation has, I believe, never been known here before. It partakes very much of the same virulent character as the diseases that at times affect the cereal world, and something of the kind was ex- perienced with terrible severity in the Canaries in 1704. Two years' failure of a vintage, in an island like Madeira, would be almost annihilation, if it were not for its other boundless vegetable resources ; and, as in the case of the destruction of the Irish root, it is augured that much good may arise to the people from the in creased stimulus to industry so occasioned, and their being induced not to place too great a dependence on any one product. Still, it is a melancholy sight to behold the support of a whole people struck down by such an inconceivable blight. Every means have been tried to arrest its progress, but without success ; and, should it continue its ravages, Madeira wine bids fare to become greatly

Nature of Malaria, Singular eifects. stantly employed in the adoption of preventive means, the surgeon should as diligently apply his knowledge of the curative treatment required. And as it has been admitted by medical men, that marsh fevers carry off or disable one-fifth of the dwellers along the Mediterranean shores, our attention to such a scourge cannot be misplaced. Although the effects of malaria are at last pretty well known to our medical corps, its mysterious nature and origin have never been hitherto unravelled ; and whether it be an atmospheric agent, whether sulphuretted or carbu- retted hydrogen gas, or whether it be a material or an aeriform substance, is stdl unknown. Notwithstanding it is notorious for infesting rice and flax grounds, morasses, and stagnant waters, the febrific tendencies of which are too well known, malaria exists independent of marshes and rank vegetation, in barren and apparently arid places. It may possibly be influenced by the drying power of the atmosphere, or the energy of evaporation under local causes, as expressed by the relation which the dew-point bears to the temperature of the atmosphere. The effluvia from marshes is presumed to indicate its presence ; but even where a warning smell may exist, its cause should be sought for, since it is as yet doubtful whether curing an efflu- vium of its scent also destroys its hurtful quality. Future discoveries may unveil the matter. That the vagaries of malaria, as evinced in effects which display but little affinity with each other, are at present almost inscrutable, is no reason for a neglect of observation and inquiry. We are told of towns where one side of a street is infected, and the other not ; of streets in which some houses alone escape ; and even of barracks in which some divisions are healthy and others filled with sick men. But in these cases the anomaly is rather apparent than real ; it may be owing to exposure of site here, or the prevalence of contagious disorders there. Sometimes the miasma has been known to rise from its marshy bed along the nearest side of
003427539	003427539_236	MALARIA. 227 the adjacent uplands, infecting all that it passes over, though becoming so rarified and dispersed as to lose its malignity at the summit. Over valleys the actien is some what different ; during the summer nights, the exhalations of the day are partly precipitated, and meeting those which for some time after sunset try to ascend, the two baneful gases concentrate. This is malaria of a most malignant type, and will be more or less pernicious according to the season of the year, and the predisposition of bodies exposed to its influence. This unseen enemy is also wafted by the winds to a considerable distance, contaminating the air of places not otherwise unhealthy, the virulence depending on local and aerial circumstances. As to season, it may be considered to prevail from the summer solstice to the ■ autumnal equinox, when fevers, visceral complaints, and general bodily derangement, mark its presence ; and it is even advanced by native physicians, that at such times fatal epidemics among men, and epizootics among cattle, display, on dissection, the same appearances of inflamma- tory affection. The operation of malaria is not much Time of . operation dreaded during day-time, since all the emanations are dissipated by the solar beams ; evening causes more cases of fever even than midnight, when the poisonous exhalation is completely condensed upon the sod; and hence those who sleep in the upper stories of houses are less liable to disease, and take it in a milder form, than those whose beds are on the ground-floor. The time of sleep seems to be the moment of attack, as the debility of the body, and the peculiar state of the local night-air, combine to aid the effective reception of miasma : foulness of stomach excites redundant bile, and consequently lays the trap for fever, but the remote cause assuredly exists in some of the volatde bodies in the atmosphere. Plague, or pestdence, being but a capricious visitor to Plague. the Mediterranean, is only here named because its effects have been confounded in history with the ravages of Q2

EFFECTS OF FIRE ON THE JUNGLES. 385 for guides and assistance ; but the Cooches were so shy and difficult to deal with, that we were generally left to our own resources. Grass is the prevailing feature of the country, as there are few shrubs, and still fewrer trees. Goats and the common Indian cow are plentiful ; but it is not swampy enough for the buffalo ; and sheep are scarce, on account of the heat of the climate. This uniformity of feature over so immense an area is, however, due to the agency of man, and is of recent introduction ; as all concur in affirming, that within the last hundred years the face of the country was covered with the same long jungle-grasses which abound in the Terai forest ; and the troops cantoned at Titalya (a central position in these plains) from 1816 to 1828, confirm this statement as far as their immediate neighbourhood is concerned. These gigantic Gramineœ seem to be destroyed by fire with remarkable facility at one season of the year ; and it is well that this is the case ; for, whether as a retainer of miasma, a shelter for wild beasts, both carnivorous and herbivorous, alike dangerous to man, or from their liability to ignite, and spread destruction far and wide, the grass jungles are most serious obstacles to civilization. Next to the rapidity with which it can be cleared, the adapta tion of a great part of the soil to irrigation during the rains, has greatly aided the bringing of it under culti vation. By far the greater proportion of this universal short turf grass is formed of Andropogon acicularis, Cynodon. Dacfylon* and in sandy places, Imperata cylindrica ; * Called " Dhob." This is the best pasture grass iu the plains of India, and the oulv one to be found over many thousands of square miles. J co VOL. I.

Birds are certainly the most conspicuous branch of the natural history of this country, and we saw many species, interesting either from their habits, beauty, or extensive distribution. We noticed no less than sixteen kinds of swimming birds, several of which are migratory and English. The Shoveller, white-eyed and common wild ducks ; Merganser, Brahminee, and Indian goose (Anser Indica) ; common and Gargany teal ; two kinds of gull ; one of Shearwater (Rhynchops ablacus) ; three of tern, and one of cormorant. Besides these there were three egrets, the large crane, stork, green heron, and the demoiselle ; the English sand-martin, kingfisher, peregrine-falcon, sparrow-hawk, kestrel, and the European vulture : the wdd peacock, and jungle-fowd. There were at least 100 peculiarly Indian birds in addition, of which the more remarkable were several kinds of mina, of starling, vulture, kingfisher, magpie, quail, and lapwing. The country gradually became cpiite beautiful, much undulated and diversified by bright green meadows, sloping lawms, and deeply wooded nullahs, wliich lead from the Sal forest and meander through this varied landscape. More beautiful sites for fine mansions could not well be, and it is difficult to suppose so lovely a country should be so malarious as it is before and after the rains, excessive heat probably diffusing widely the miasma from small stagnant surfaces. We noticed a wild hog, absolutely the first wild beast of any size I saw on the plains, except the hispid hare (Lepus hispidus) and the barking deer (Stylocerus ratna). The hare we found to be the best game of this part of Iffdia, except the teal. The pheasants of Dorjiling are poor, the deer all but uneatable, and the

I hinted this idea to Captain Taylor, Dr. Baikie, and Dr. Hutchinson, that a trial might be made of keeping the wood in the canoes, and only calling for it as occasion required : they all at once agreed to take every precaution which might be likely to conduce to health. July 18 : Got under weigh at seven A.M., and steamed past many villages on both banks; several canoes came off. The banks were about six feet above the water's edge, at intervals, on both sides ; one is not impressed with the idea of a swamp by the sight of these high banks. The wind was fresh and pleasant. About noon, we were opposite a group of villages on the left bank, where a creek with plenty of water entered the main river ; we followed it up about half-an-hour, but as it grew narrow and covered with green stuff and weeds, we returned ; the natives also told us that it was not the way to king Obi. As we were returning, we met two canoes which were following us, waving a white piece of cloth as a sign of peace. It appears this signal is well known all along the river, and a great way into the interior. They told us that the creek led into the bush, and into a very narrow passage, which they called a hole. They received some trifling presents. About three o'clock we were opposite the villages

When it was too late, the Servians, as well as their neigh bours the Croats, saw how treacherously they had been made the instruments of a government, whose only object in ex citing race against race, was to break down the strength of the Magyars, that it might rule uncontrolled over the rights and liberties of a free people; but it has left memories rankling in the heart of these people, which will one day exact a terrible retribution. The only place worth mentioning between Carlowitz and Semlin, is Slankaman, the Ritium of the Romans; here the Theiss, one of the most important rivers in Hungary, after traversing the whole of that country and Transylvania, forms a junction with the Danube. The banks of this river are, with few exceptions, considered unhealthy, partly owing to the sluggish pace at which the stream travels, and partly to the inundations, which on retiring leave extensive marshes , but however injurious to the health of man, the miasma does not appear to have the same effect on that mud-loving animal, the buffalo, which here comes to great perfection. On leaving the Theiss we steered our course between nume rous small islands to Semlin, opposite Belgrade, where the Save and the Danube uniting, form the boundary between Turkey, and the Slavonian provinces of Hungary. , Now that important changes may be anticipated in those vast countries situated on the Lower Danube, in consequence of the war between Turkey and Russia, perhaps it may in terest the reader if we give him some account of the origin and history of the Servian nationality, the most brave and enterprising of all the Slavonian races. We already see that the belligerents attach the utmost importance to the free principality of Servia, each inclining to the opinion that the side on which this warlike people shall array themselves, will

There are, however, some signs of improvement at Jassy, since we see here and there an elegant mansion recently erected, and others in the hands of the builder. We can also admire the pretty palace of the reigning prince, and that belonging to the real sovereign, the Russian Consul ; but as these stately structures are in juxtaposition with the hut of a tallow-chandler, or that of a dealer in old clothes, the in congruous picture reminds the beholder that he sees civiliza tion struggling with barbarism, which is the real character of all these countries, and their towns and cities, on the Lower Danube, so long devastated by wars between the horde of Othman and the horde of Muscovy. It is, however, in con templation (!) to pave the town; and roads are actually being made in the environs, which are intended to form a network throughout the entire principality. Then the little army, officered by Russians, and drilled according to the most approved system of that great disciplinarian, the Tzar of all the Russias, reminds the traveller that they are only waiting to be joined by their companions in arms at a more conve nient season. Altogether, Jassy offers but little to interest a stranger beyond a glance at its motley inhabitants. There are Boyards and Turks, Greeks, Armenians, Slavonians, and Jews, to be seen, all adhering as strictly to their own language and
003460214	003460214_252	240 TURKEY, RUSSIA, shadowed it, as if it were in another hemisphere. Yet of all the seas in the Old World there is none more advantageously situated, none that would more effectually, with the aid of either road, railway, or water communication, connect the trade of Europe and Asia; however, to render this more available, the canal* to which we alluded in a former chapter, for uniting the Danube and the Black Sea, must be cut; which in fact would only be the reopening of the ancient mouth of the Danube, as nearly half its course is already filled with water. If this were done, the countries of Western Europe would find a never-failing granary in the fertile countries of the Lower Danube, together with every other article of commerce or raw material, which the merchant is now obliged to pur chase at a much higher rate at Odessa; in addition to these advantages, mountains of salt abound in Wallachia, sufficient to supply the whole of the Levant, timber in any quantity, to say nothing of the millions of swine in Servia, and the numerous flocks and herds in Moldo-Wallachia, all of which by the canal could reach Constantinople in a few days. Then we have the shores of the Black Sea, which offer in Circassia, Immeretia, Mingrelia, Georgia, Armenia, and the whole of the Anatolian coast, mines of unexplored wealth to the * We know of no undertaking, no enterprise, either in a commercial or political point of view, comparable to one which would unite two quarters of the globe, nor one that could be completed at such a trifliug cost, when we say that it could be done, including cutting, banking, dredging, and piling, for a sum not exceeding 200,000^. It is scarcely necessary to observe how great would be the profits to the contractors, or how great, how invaluable the advantage to the trading interests of every country, — except, indeed, Russia ; as it would reduce the navi gation of the Danube in this part of the river from a month or more of dangerous windings through sandbanks and miasma to about two days' voyage. It also happens most fortunately for the enterprise that at Kistenddji a headland runs out into the sea, affording the necessary shelter for ships. Add to which, the holdiog is good; nor is the coast, being here high aud well defined, exposed to the fogs aud currents of the Delta of tlie Danube.

The Tatars of the Russian steppe, like all pastoral people whose wants are few, can procure for themselves a sufficiency of 'the mere necessaries of life, but nothing beyond; and, owing to the admirable system of each tribe providing for the necessities of all its members who suffer from misfortune, sickness, or old age, we never meet with a person in a state of absolute destitution. Their villages, which are generally partly buried in the earth, or burrowed into the banks of some dried-up river, where water flowed, perhaps, two thou sand years ago, are miserable in the extreme — nothing better than a species of human warren. However, here, as in the low lands of Moldo-Wallachia, these semi-barbarian tribes have shown their wisdom; for while the colonist, who has built himself a comfortable house above ground, suffers from ophthalmia and intermittent fever, the Tatar seldom or never becomes the victim of either, — experience having proved that the miasma is only dangerous at a certain distance from the earth. We had an opportunity, while wandering some years ago in the vicinity of the Putrid Sea, and the Sea of Azow, the most insalubrious part of the Crimea, of proving the cor rectness of this opinion, as we invariably observed, before the rising and after the setting of the sun, a heavy mist hanging over the earth, when it was only necessary to ascend a tumu lus, or descend into a Tatar hut, to be completely beyond its influence.
003460214	003460214_306	293 THE BLACK SEA, AND CIRCASSIA. healthy, add to which there is a great deficiency of pure water. Again, the pestilential air arising from the marshy districts on the Circassian frontier of the Kouban consti tutes alone a formidable barrier to the advance of a Russian army in this direction; for should the natives defend the passes with vigour, and prevent their entrance into the fortress of Anapa, they would be obliged either to bivouac in the swamps, or recross the Kouban, frequently impracticable, as this river is sometimes unexpectedly increased to a torrent by the rain in the higher Alps in a few hours. Should any misfortune of this kind occur, — and it has happened more than once, — the entire army would then be at the mercy of two inexorable foes — marsh miasma, and the unceasing hostility of the guerilla of the Caucasus. The Kouban, like every other river that has its source in an alpine region, and at the same time but a short course from that region to the sea, is subject to great variations — now shallow and sluggish, aud again, when fed by heavy rains and the melting of the snow in the mountains, rolling like a raging torrent, and flooding its banks to a vast extent, particularly on the Circassian side, where there is nothing to be seen for many miles but a forest of reeds, which, beneath the burning sun of Asia, attain a most extraordinary height. As far as the eye could reach, we traced from the deck of our vessel the chain of Cossack guard-houses, as we passed along the mouth of the Kouban, each with its own redoubt and primitive watch-tower, consisting of three perpendicular poles fastened in the earth, having a seat on the top exactly resembling an eagle's nest, upon which a seutinel was seated, watching the movements of his wary enemy, the Circassians, on the other side of the Kouban, but who, notwithstanding all his vigilance, frequently cross the river at low water; and, unless every man is instantly under arms, their villages are burnt, and everything, even to the cattle in the fields, carried

After visiting the ruins of a church and a monastery on the coast, which we may regard as an evidence that this people were once converted to Christianity, we followed the windings of a beautiful river, the Phandra, which led us to the fortress, distant about three miles. Like that at Pitzounda, the vegetation was of the most luxuriant description; the splendid oak-trees alone, that covered the sides of the hills, and crested the highest summits of the mountains, were in such abundance, as to lead us to believe that Europe would find a sufficient supply of the finest wood for ship-building in these nearly unknown coun tries on the Black Sea, without seeking it in another hemi sphere. Mingrelia, Immeretia, Gourial, and the Turkish provinces of Asia Minor, are equally rich in this material as Circassia. In addition to the ordinary trees of the forest, the arbutus andrachne, the oleander, the tamarisk, the olive, and the fig, the rhododendron and the pomegranate, were every where to be seen in all their variegated tints and rich luxuri ance ; while the box, which in Europe is a dwarf shrub, was here a perfect giant of the forest, and the juniper of such colossal dimensions as to measure fifteen feet in circum ference. But death lurked about our path, in the number of dangerous black snakes that continually darted almost from beneath our feet ; then the croaking of the rana variabilis, that unerring indicator of poisonous marsh miasma, told us, if we did not seek the shelter of our ships before night-fall, we should be certain to cany home with us the intermittent fever of the Caucasus. The fact is, the fertility of the low lands in the Caucasus is too great; for, harassed as the inhabitants have been from
003460214	003460214_327	THE BLACK SEA, AND CIRCASSIA. 313 time immemorial by the continued invasions of every ambi tious power of the day, they have been obliged to leave their richest lands a waste on the coast, and seek a securer home in the mountains. They also know, from experience and the traditions of their ancestors, that if their enemies only resided a few months in one of their beautiful valleys on the coast, the poisonous marsh miasma would thin their ranks far more rapidly than the sword. It will scarcely be credited when we say, that the Caucasus alone costs Russia annually 30,000 men! After visiting the fortress, which as usual was crowded with the sick and dying, we took a lounge through the little town of Bombora, or, as the Circassians call it, Lehna, exhi biting the same characteristics as those we had described in Turkey. The inhabitants were, for the most part, Tatars and Karaite Jews from the Crimea, Armenians, and Turks. As to Circassians, there were but few; this warlike race always preferring the more exciting life of the chase and war to the peaceable one of the counter. There were several ar mourers in the town, from whom our party purchased some splendid sabres and poniards of the very finest workmanship, and evidently of great antiquity; the blades were for the most part engraved, or inlaid with gold characters. Prince Worronzow procured a splendid sabre with the following interesting inscription, Parmi Bey y par my Rey, which evi dently once belonged to a crusader. Indeed, we were informed by an Armenian merchant of the place, who frequently visited the interior of the Caucasus, that there actually exists a tribe called the Khervisour, living in a district at the base of Mount Elbrous, who still preserve some of the forms of Christianity ; and when they go to war, use a different armour from that of the Circassian knights, with the figure of a cross on their bucklers, and one of red cloth on their breast.

Besides these, there were several other tribes from the remote districts of the Caucasus equally interesting ; and as they were all on friendly terms with the Russian government, they were allowed to purchase salt, tobacco, and powder, the latter however in small quantities. From the circumstance of the Mingrelians and Immeretians being allowed to retain their arms, we must infer that the power of Russia is not firmly established over these provinces, as the same privilege is not granted to her subjects of Georgia and Russian Armenia. At all events, the Russian soldier of the garrison may felicitate himself upon possessing one advantage over his comrades of all the other Russian forts we visited in the Caucasus, he has only a single enemy to contend with at Redout-Kale — marsh miasma. In fact, the authority of Russia over these provinces, Min- grelia, Immeretia, and Gourial, is extremely precarious. She knows well that so long as she is at war with the inhabitants of Daghestan and the Western Caucasus, the slightest infringe- ment upon the liberties of the people — for they are very tena- cious of their freedom — would lead to a rebellion, and, it might be, endanger the loss of Georgia, a province which from its position is the key to all her Trans-Caucasian possessions. Hence she has not dared to introduce her usual complicated machinery of passports and fiscal laws, neither bas she inun- dated the country with an army of officials to enforce the various harassing regulations, by means of which she knows so well how to enslave every people that has had the mis- fortune to fall under her rule. No doubt there would be a very different system pursued if she succeeded in subduing the untamed and untameable spirit of Daghestan and Circassia. z

The tents of the chieftains, or those more fastidious in their taste, are usually composed of several pieces of felt, and when these are furnished with a carpet, and a chimney to carry away the smoke, they form by no means an indifferent dwelling. Again, if we take into consideration the waterproof texture of the Caucasian tchaouka, a cloak made from a mixture of long sheep's wool and goat's hair, there is no soldier better provided, so far as clothing is concerned, with the means of supporting the vicissitudes of a guerilla campaign. Here ho may sit, enveloped in his cloak and sheltered beneath his tent, and bid defiance to the elements; while the unfortunate Russian soldier, in his flimsy jacket, linen trowsers, thread hare surtout, and with no other retreat from the tempest than his canvas tent, (if indeed his government is so considerate as to provide him with one,) is certain to be invalided aster a few summers' campaign, — for the moist and heated atmosphere of the Caucasian valleys becomes so charged with miasma after heavy rains, that no man, however robust, can withstand its effects without using the precautions adopted by the natives. The Russian soldier also, having his best energies chilled by living beneath a system of despotism and slavery, wants the elasticity of spirit and independence of action so visible in the movements of the Caucasian mountaineer, where every defile, towering cliff, and snow-clad alp reminds him of the strength of his mountain home, and imparts a courage and a manliness to his every action. Unconquered and unconquer- able, he believes himself superior to the whole human race; and truly, when he contrasts his own wild freedom, the secu rity he enjoys in the undisturbed patrimony of his ancestors, with the servile condition of his neighbour, the degraded serf
001990032	001990032_514	102 ANCIENT AND MODERN When Ceylon was in its prime, a conquering island, issuing forth from its ocean home to spread its arms and its religion in India and the Eastern peninsula, it has been calculated that it contained five millions of inhabitants ; now, in the days of its degeneracy and debasement, after Portuguese, Dutch, and British have partiaUy or enthely con quered it in turn, and after centuries of previous civil strife, before Europeans made their appearance at aU, it does not contain much more than a fifth of the number. Then the extensive level district, stretching away to the north, was densely popu lated, its tanks and artificial water-courses fertiliz ing the ground, and producing, under careful cul tivation, abundant crops for the supply of the large masses of the people and for exportation — now that level district, with the richest possible sod, is deserted by the natives, part of it has never been explored by Europeans, and the whole is covered with thick, almost impenetrable, jungle ; the tanks and w^ater-courses that formerly enabled the inha bitants to irrigate theh* rice-fields, and surround theh abodes with the blessings of plenty and wealth, are now the fruitful sources of miasma and contagion. The artificial mounds and embank ments, often of the most gigantic character, are broken or scattered uselessly about, whilst the country is fruitlessly inundated, and thick, tan-

Cabeza de Vaea made an attempt, with 300 of his people, to penetrate into the interior, but was forced, from want of supplies, to retrace his steps. Other efforts, made by some of his officers, to explore the country in different directions were equally fruitless. In the mean time the periodical inundations commenced, and, covering the country with water and miasma, caused fever and agues and great sickness amongst the people ; myriads of musquitoes tormented them incessantly, and the vampires attacked them by night with terrible effect. The Adelan tado himself woke one morning bleeding so severely from the bite of one of these creatures that at first he believed he had been stabbed by an assassin. He was very sick with the fever, and the greater part of the soldiers com pletely prostrated. There were no provisions to be had, and the state of the people became daily more distressing. Nevertheless the Adelantado would have remained where he was till the waters subsided, in order to renew his examination of the country, but the people would not hear of it, and insisted upon being taken back at once to Paraguay, whither he was obliged in very ill-humour to return with them. Before re-embarking, he thought fit to issue an order that about a hundred Indian women should be restored to their families, who on their first arrival had been brought by their parents to take up their abode with the Spaniards ; — an order which so exasperated the men, already dis gusted with the expedition, that they were with difficulty restrained from at once throwing off their obedience to him. They reached Assumption in April (1544) in high dudgeon, and greatly dissatisfied with their commander. Unfortunately for him, during his absence other persons, and especially the King's officers, headed by Caceres, the Contador, had been working at Assumption to discredit his measures and to undermine his authority. They had been irritated by some disputes with him as to their rights and perquisites before his departure, and now, emboldened

It is surrounded by mountains, which, it is said, were formerly covered with dense forests, whose dark, thick shadows eternally brooded over the waters, from which such a fatal miasma arose as to render its vicinity dangerous. It is not so now, however. The banks of the lake are charming, it is full of excellent fish, and the air is healthy. The depth is 400 feet. The entrance to the famous grotto of the Sybil is opposite this lake, and further on is the famous river Styx, and for aught I know, the grim old ferryman, Charon, was waiting for some passengers — we did not go in to see. Without seeing half the curiosities worthy of notice in Naples, we were obliged to leave, and taking the steamboat Lombardy at 5 o'clock, r. m., we reached Civita Vecchia, 185 miles, early in the morning. There was only one lady beside myself in the lady's cabin, and we were startled in the night by a noise near us, and looking out of our berths, we found a man rummaging the pockets of our dresses, which were hung up, probably in the expectation of finding money. It seems as if the Italians could not live without begging or stealing. As soon as it was light in the morn- ing, we were told that the health officers were on board and would soon be in the cabin to see what condition we were in. My companion jumped up and hastily dressed herself, but I contented myself with putting my head out from the curtains, and telling the officer that I was alive. We were soon, however, summoned up on deck, to be counted and numbered, and go through a comical ceremony, which last ed an hour. Every one was compelled to come forward as his name was called and be numbered, and then march in single file the length of the vessel like a row of State's pri soners, and be counted like a flock of sheep.

If our sanitary commissioners do not exaggerate the doleful effects of Avant of drainage in our toAvns, and the mortal diseases engendered by the proximity of stagnant waters to our dwellings, it is surprising that the human race has not become extinct here, and generally in the north of Europe. An islet in a pool, or bog, or marsh, Avas a chosen spot for kings and nobles to build a residence upon ; and, for the people, a village or town was not habitable, unless it had the defence of a pond, or marsh, on one side ; and if the place had this advantage on two sides, like Hamburgh, and every important place of any antiquity, it soon became a city. People in former times had a sharper enemy than fever and ague to guard against, and safety from surprise, a small front to defend, and a retreat by Avater on one or more sides, have evidently been the considerations upon which the site of every ancient tOAvn, Rome itself not excepted, has been chosen or preferred. In this old town, the Schloss of Gottorp, a square lump of a building in the French chateau style, built upon an ancient site, has been the residence of branches of royal families, or inhabited by the go vernors of the province, until our times ; and it is situated in a stagnant pool, overgroAvn Avith reeds, and reeking with miasma. This little metropolis Avas supported by the expen diture of the incomes of the functionaries and de partments connected with the government of the duchy of SlesAvick. There Avas all the machinerv of

Strange as it may seem, it is nevertheless true, that Ceylon found no sufficient protection in its remote ness from the turbulent scenes of 1848, against the sporadic influence of the revolutionary miasma that overspread Europe in the spring of that year. The intelligence that monarchy had been overthrown, and a republic established in France, though received Avith indifference by the Tamils in the French settlement of Pondicherry, was eagerly employed to arouse the long suppressed wishes of the Kandyans for the restoration of their national independence 1 ; at a time, moreover, Avhen a variety of circumstances concurred to fan the tendency to discontent.2 The exertions which, not withstanding an excess of outlay over income, Avere successfully made by the government of Viscount Tor rington to improve the financial system and relieve the commerce of the island by revising the tariff, had entailed the duty of re-distributing taxation, so as to extend some share of the burden to classes AAdiich had long been accustomed to almost total exemption from fiscal demands. In order to include the native population, who had previously contributed little to the public revenue, ordinances were passed to impose a small tax on shops, on fire-arms and dogs 3, and to re quire from each adult male six days' labour in the year tended to place some check on their possession by improper persons, and the tax on dogs was designed to diminish their numbers, and thus obviate the barbarous expedient of their annual slaughter in the streets.

If interrupted in their industry, by the dread of such events, they retired tiU the storm had blown over, and returned, after each temporary disper sion, to resume possession of the lands and then village tank. The desolation which now reigns over the plains which the Singhalese formerly tiUed, was precipitated by the reckless domination of the Malabars, in the four teenth and fodowing centimes. The destruction of reservoirs and tanks has been ascribed to defective con struction, and to the absence of spdl-waters, and other facihties for discharging the surplus-water, during the prevalence of excessive rains ; but independently of the fact that vast numbers of these tanks, though utterly deserted, remain, in this respect, almost uninjured to the present day, we have the evidence of their own native historians, that for upwards of fifteen centuries, the reservoirs, when duly attended to, successfrdly defied aU the dangers to be apprehended from inundation. Their destruction and abandonment are ascribable, not so much to any engineering defect, as to the disruption of the viUage communities, by whom they were so long maintained. The ruin of a reservoir, when neglected and permitted to saU into decay, was speedy and inevi table ; and as the destruction of the viUage tank involved the flight of aU dependent upon it, the water, once per mitted to escape, carried pestilence and miasma over the plains they had previously covered with plenty. After such a calamity any partial return of the villagers, even where it was not prevented by the dread of malaria, would have been impracticable ; for the obvious reason, that where the whole combined labour of the commu nity was not more than sufficient to cany on the work of conservancy and cultivation, the diminished force of a few would have been utterly unavailing, either to effect the reparation of the watercourses, or to restore the system on which the culture of rice depends. Thus the process of decay, instead of a gradual decline as in

I found practising in the island of Panay Dr. Lefevre, whom I had known in Egypt more than twenty years before, and who was one of the cou- rageous men who boldly grappled with the current superstitions respecting the contagious character of the Oriental plague, and the delusions as to the efficacy of quarantine regulations, so really useless, costly, and vexatious. He placed in my hand some observations which he had published at Bombay in 1840, where vessels from the Red Sea were subjected to sanatory visitations. He asserts that plague is only generated at particular seasons, in certain definable conditions of the atmosphere, and when miasma is created by the decomposition of decaying matter ; that endemic plague is unknown in countries where proper atten- tion is paid to hygienic precautions ; that severe cold or intense heat equally arrests the progress of the plague ; that the epoch of its ravages is always one when damp and exposed animal and vegetable substances emit the greatest amount of noxious gases ; and that plague has never been known to originate or to spread where the air is in a state of purity. I was glad to rediscuss the matter with him after so ong an added experience, and to find he had been more and more confirmed in his former conclusions by prolonged residence in the tropics, where endemic and epidemic diseases partake of the pestilential cha racter, though they do not assume the forms, of the

Again, this was a mitigation of the punishment, which was, by the articles of war, " death ." Hong-Kong had most astonishingly improved in appearance since my last visit, with many substantial additions. We had now a theatre, hotels, a site for a church, a governor, and one or two streets forming — Queen Street, Cat Street, &c. Still there was " Happy Valley," the untimely grave of many an unfortunate. The place was still sickly, and many deaths, notwith standing every precaution ; the town, during the S.E. monsoon of six months, was in a perpetual calm, the miasma and malaria arising and taken up by the in tolerable heat of the sun during the day, fell again as dew during the night ; every one was spiritless and desponding. A grand pic-nic was given to-day, to which I, as a stranger, was invited. It was an ebullition of good feeling from the mids. to the Admiral, Captain, and ward-room officers, of the ship I now belonged to. AU went in Chinese boats, but on shoving off from the ship, a wdd and careless midshipman fired a pistol by accident, and blew away all the lower jaw and collar bone of an intelligent little Chinese boy who was attend ing on us (as he spoke Enghsh). He was hoisted in and his wounds dressed ; he was terribly disfigured. Away we went to Cowloon, the mainland of China, over rocks and hills, firing our guns at stray pigs, cocks, dogs, and poultry. A pig was shot by one of our young fellows, for which he had to pay five dollars. Arrived at a clean

When this, the third and the severest spasm, had passed away, he called for pen and paper, and fearing that increased weakness of mind and body might presently prevent any exertion, he Avrote an incoherent letter of farewell to his family. That, however, Avas the crisis. He was afterwards able to take the proper precautions, never moving without assistance, and always ordering a resting-place to be prepared for him. He spent a better night, with the inconvenience, hoAvever, of sitting up, pillow-propped, and some weeks elapsed before he could lie upon his sides. Presently, the pains Avere mitigated, though they did not entirely cease : this he expressed by say ing that "the knives were sheathed." Such, gentle reader, in East Africa, is the kichyoma-chyoma : either one of those eccentric after-effects of fever, which per plex the European at Zanzibar, or some mysterious manifestation of the Protean demon Miasma. I at once sent an express to Snay bin Amir for the necessary drugs.

By some singular oversight, no accommodation, tents or otherwise, had been provided ashore for the 650 hammils we had brought into Balaclava, They clamoured to be permitted to land in vain; they clamoured for more water, and before sunset fever broke out among them. Some of these stricken poor wretches were laid upon the upper deck, and tended by one or two of their comrades. Fortunately, we had lemons on board, and medical men; but it was an ill-judged act to keep those unhappy men two days and two nights on board a transport in such an unhealthy spot, breathing miasma, and crowded together under the rays of a July sun, gasping for air and water. One of the beauties of the port consists in the protecting position of the hills around it, which exclude every breath of air or capful of wind, save the faint whiffs that may effect an entrance at the upper end of the harbour, via the marsh and its Aceldama. I turned into my berth with anything but plea surable feelings. I felt disappointed — depressed ; and a fit of cold shivering warned me to commence with the quinine directly, if I meant to stave off an attack of fever. They had a Kertch piano (a prize, of course) on board a transport next to ours, upon which some musical genius, with a very heavy hand,

The walls of the city, in the plain, are still very dis tinct — very fine walls they have been and marvellously massive : history tells that they were wide enough for two chariots to drive abreast on them. We were very much pleased with Antioch — there is much variety in the scenery — the mountain peaks are more sudden and varied than is usual in Syria — the plain is particu larly rich — and the river is a very noble stream ; in its days of glory Antioch must indeed have been magnifi cent, — it was called the third city in the world. It is a remarkably healthy place : the strong breeze down the wide, open valley blows away all miasma, so that fevers and epidemics are little known. The people are some what fanatical, but thrifty and industrious. We left Antioch after a few days' most pleasant sojourn in the hospitable house of our Consul, and wended our way along the rich, flat plain, fording many small streams and passing several ancient ruined bridges and aque ducts, around each and all of which were complete forests of oleander. After about five hours' slow riding we turned up one of the defiles of the Amanus moun-
000240672	000240672_325	ISKENDEROON. 316 We found a delightful garden just beyond the town, where we encamped under the shade of fine pome o-ranate trees, then in full blossom — whence we could make excursions, on foot, among the rocks and gardens of the ravine, until it was time to go down to meet the steamer at Iskenderoon (or Alexandretta). Just beyond the town, the road has been cut through the promontory on the east side ofthe gorge to the depth of about forty feet — this was the " Iron Gate," — here a handful of men could have kept a large army at bay for almost any length of time — so tremendously steep are the sides of the ravine. Passing round this projecting cliff, the sea burst upon our view — the vast Bay of Issus — with the beautiful snow-covered heights of the Taurus Mountains on the other side and Iskenderoon on the little plain by the shore ; — our steamer was descried waiting there, even her colours visible in the clear air — we descended to the plain in two hours, winding through delightful woods all the time and enjoying the noble panorama. But after the fresh, sweet, healthy moun tain air the stifling heat of the unwholesome marshy plain, reeking with fever was most disagreeable : it is said that a very little drainage would render this plain perfectly healthy and productive — the soil is very rich, but so deadly is the miasma that there are scarcely any inhabitants to cultivate it ; the town is a miserable collection of huts, mostly made of osiers and wattles, with the strange little sleeping-places mounted up on high poles, such as we had seen at Banias, to ensure the occupants from snakes, scorpions, &c. We did not linger longer in the town than to see the caravan for Baghdad starting on its long march, and another for Aleppo — both carry on the passengers and merchandise brought by the steamers : the road from this to Bagh-

I had a raging headache — for the Jerusalem fever then lurking in me was brought out instantly by exposure to the slightest miasma — and it was therefore with but half-opened eyes that I saw the shores of Syria receding from us as we pushed off in the little boat from Iskenderoon. Exactly one year and one week had elapsed since we had first touched the shores of Syria in this very spot, when the snowy mountains and the glowing oleanders had given us as sweet a welcome as they now bade us a kind good-bye : then — much as we anticipated and expected, we little knew the pleasure and happiness in store for us; — now — the serene days of our dear httle mountain home — the magnificent country rides — the glorious Desert and the wild Be doueen — the long, long stay in the desolated but ever Holy and beloved City — bright and sunny hours with kind and valued friends — all rushed into my mind, and made my heart sink with the same feeling as that of parting from a long and tenderly loved companion, as my foot quitted that sandy shore. Farewell, most Holy Land — Farewell, dear and beautiful Syria; already the blood of her massacred natives was crying out from the earth, and the flame and the smoke of her burning houses was rising into the unclouded sky, and yet we dared to hope and beheve that the day will come when industry and enterprise will be spread throughout the country, and happy homesteads clothe the mountains and fill the pleasant valleys — when truth and justice and honesty

She implored her mother not to impose on her so mournful a ceremony, against which an insurmountable horror and mysterious terror caused her to revolt. But the empress was fixed as destiny, and the archduchess burst into tears as she entered the carriage which would bear her to the mo nastery, and shuddered as she went down the steps that led to the crypt. Three months previously her sister-in-law, the second wife of the Emperor Joseph H., had been buried there; she had died of small-pox, that scourge of the House of Austria, which the Habsburgs could not resist. The malady had made such ravages on the princess, that the operation of embalming was deemed necessary. Her body diffused a frightful odour, and the report ran even among the populace that, in spite of all sanitary measures, the miasma from the corpse still pervaded the tomb. The result justified this opinion, for the archduchess had scarce quitted the gloomy tenement of the dead, than she was attacked by a dull feeling of uneasiness. Soon after the small-pox declared itself, the efforts of science failed against this terrible evil, and on the 15th of October, just a month before the day fixed for her departure, the young princess breathed her last sigh. The crowns laid upon tombs were substituted for her nuptial coronet, and the mourning tapers formed the only illumination in her honour. The heart of a mother, however much it may be for tified against natural feelings, does not receive such blows without shuddering. The empress, from this time, 82

A sand-mist rose on the plain in front, and underneath the surface glistened as if some broad stream were sleeping in the simbeams. So complete was the illusion that P. declared it was a marsh, and muffled his face in a handkerchief to avoid the miasma. Beyond this from left to right stretched a dense date-forest, amidst which three tall minarets in the distance marked the position ofthe city of Waregla. To the north we could descry two caravans of camels creeping in long file towards the trees. And now we had gained the last oasis in the Great Sahara. Nothing but the ocean of the mighty Libyan desert was beyond until Touat was reached to the west ward. We sent forward our first horseman with our commendatory letter to Sidi Zobeir, the Ealiph of Waregla, and a fast friend of the French government. The sleeping lake resolved itself into salt incrus tations on the sand. Every plant as we descended was new and strange, but once in the plain itself there was not a vestige of vegetation. It was sim ply the broad bed of the Wed el Mia (river of the hundred streams), which had gone to foUow their African confreres, whether above or below ground de ponent sayeth not. The mists and exhalations proved dry indeed. Riding across the fine penetrating sand, we gradually mounted to the oasis, by far the largest we had seen. Having heard that Sidi Zobeir was camped on the outside of the city, we halted in the palm-groves. Low black tents peeped everywhere from the blue bushes or contrasted with the white sand-hillocks.

Doubtful Eoman remains — Tuggurt the metropolis of the Wed R'hir — Allusions of Shaw and Leo Afrieanus — Political constitution — A fortunate shepherd — Wars with Constantine — Capture by General Desvaux — Deposition ofthe Sultan — Mussulman Jews — Jewellers — Massacre of the Beni M'zab — Ruined mosque — Horticulture — Trade and commerce — Ancient artesian wells — Pestilential miasma — The Dour, or " Turn again " of invaders. Of the history of Tuggurt nothing accurate was known before the French conquest of Biskra in 1848. Indeed it may be questioned whether any European, except perchance a captive, had ever visited the Wed R'hir— certainly Dr. Shaw had not ;* and, copious and accurate as are his descriptions of many districts he had never * It is evident that, though Dr. Shaw visited the whole sea-coast of Algeria and Tunis when accompanying the army of the Dey, yet he never penetrated far into the interior, and he never, through out his work, asserts his personal knowledge of those regions. There are trifling mistakes in the copying of many of the inscriptions given' in his Travels, especially of those from the interior of Tunis. Now there exists in Tunis a MS. account of the interior of that Regency in the Spanish language, apparently the work of some ecclesiastic. This volume descended to the late Dutch consul from bis grandmother, the widow of a former consul. This old lady, it is traditionally stated in her family, was personally acquainted with Dr. Shaw, who remained for some time in her house. The MS. contains all the inscriptions from the interior given by Shaw, as well as many others, and the very inaccuracies in the Doctor's work are all to be found in it. Mr. Davis, in whose possession the MS. I believe now is, stated to me that there is internal evidence of its being of a date ante cedent to Dr. Shaw. If this be so, we bave here indisputably the source whence the worthy Doctor derived his information of those districts which he had not been able personally to explore.

XIX.] SAVED BY TOBACCO -SMOKE. 211 The fact seems almost miraculous, and I should have doubted the nature of the malady had it not been ac knowledged and dreaded by every one, the natives as well as ourselves. I can only account for our immunity by the free use of tobacco. What a luxury as well as safeguard in this pest-bouse was tobacco ! Every one smoked it. It was so cheap as to be within the reach of all ; for if any one was so absolutely destitute as to be unable to procure it, he was liberally supplied by his neighbours. There is hardly a person in the kingdom who does not smoke. I observe, in reading an account of a recent mission to the Court of Ava, by Captain Yule, that the King and Queen both smoked cigars while seated on the Throne, even at a state reception, and that it is no breach of etiquette, either in a stranger or a subject, to smoke a cheroot during an audience, though I never saw this attempted.* Our prison imitated the example of the Palace — tbe atmo sphere was often so beclouded that it had the appear ance of the densest fog, — it overpowered all hurtful miasma, that of smallpox not excepted ; and such was our faith in its purifying properties, that we did certainly smoke with increased vigour while tbe infected person was in our company. Irrespective of infective disease, the effluvium from so many bodies in a confined space might have created deadly evils, but for the coun teracting force of tobacco-smoke. We all acknowledged that we were indebted to it for the preservation of our lives. As each scrap of intelligence arrived from the seat of war, or as any change or caprice influenced the mind of L * Yule's Embassy, page 85.

I believe, however, he took the cocked hat, and will probably astonish future visiters by wearing it when paying them a visit. There were very few articles of European clothing among these people. Captain Snooks speaks English fairly. This knowledge of English possessed by the Nicobarese, of which we found evidence on all the islands, seemed to be remarkable, since the visits of ships with English speaking crews cannot be very frequent. On one occasion I overheard the Lascar Ali talking English to a Nicobarese, though I had previously no idea that he understood a word of the lan guage. We did not meet any of the personages bearing the distinguished and aristocratic names mentioned by the author of the " Novara" account, and alluded to on a previous page. On landing I started up a creek which I endeavoured to follow, but after going about half-a-mile through mud, which was often up to my knees, and might at any moment have been up to my neck, I was obliged to stop. Had the tide been in, this creek would have been navigable. The only birds I saw were some whimbrel and curlew, but they would not let me get within range. The Nicobarese who followed me had all along been endeavour ing to make me turn back. One man continually calling out "go road." I then, much to their disgust, and subsequently too to my own, struck off into the bordering mangroves, expecting to meet solid ground within a few yards; instead of which I had a weary tramp of nearly a mile through fetid mud and rotten mangrove stems, where I caught two water snakes, but saw no birds. The miasma which arose as I walked was fast beginning to affect my head. On reaching the jungle I went off with a number of natives to a village, where I drank some cocoa nut milk and brandy, and began to shake off the evil effects, but for the whole of the day the fetid vapours seemed as it were to follow me. The village was a poor one; I only looked into one or two of the houses, and they did not appear to be nearly so comfortable as those on most of the other islands. The people are of much lighter build than those at Nan kowri; their mouths, too, are less disfigured by pawn chewing.

The current, in the canebrake murmured strange lullabies, and the soughing of the night wind in the tree tops sounded drowsy and sleep-inviting; but it wouldn't do : the blanket threatened me with suffocation, and with my head unprotected I would not trust myself to nap for fear of awakening exsanguis. The morning chill hardly abated the fierce buzz around me, but to my delight our craft got under way with the first twilight, and the clouds overhead seemed to veil a vertical sun, when a shower at length awakened me from a trance-like slumber in some crevice of the luggage-pile. I have often wondered if the human hide can become mosquito-proof, and I believe that our tropical red-skins become hardened against at least the after-effects of a gnat sting, — against the venom that distinguishes the bite of most winged insects from that of a flea. By a many thousand fold repetition of the doses their epidermis becomes, as it were, inoculated with the poison and ceases to be affected by its virulent stimulus. They feel a mosquito-bite only as we should feel the puncture of the smallest needle-point, and old swamp-rangers may at last get callous to even this mechanical irritation, as blacksmiths get indurated to flying sparks and Bedouins to a sand-storm. This anœsthesis and the fur, feather, and scale armor of wild beasts are Nature's preventives, and probably superior to the best artificial remedies. A sweltering night makes it doubtful if a mos quito-bar is the lesser evil, and the peace obtained by fetid ointments is certainly too dear bought. Experimental phi losophy, however, has devised a more comfortable, though not quite infallible, expedient. Mosquitoes, like mildew and miasma, hug the ground, the bogs and the rank under-

The transit by railway across the Isthmus of Panama is so well known by travellers that very little description is now needed. The notorious inch-flity of the employe's and the discomfort of the carriages, coupled with the ex orbitant tariff of £6 for about fifty miles distance, render this part of the journey so unpleasant in every way that no one would use this railway were there any other means available of passing the Isthmus ; but as the Panama Railway Company have at present a monopoly of the inter-oceanic traffic, they probably think that civility and reason able treatment of passengers is quite an unnecessary item of management, their trade not being likely to be driven away until they have had a lifetime of their profits. The country on the Pacific side of the hills that run through the Isthmus, and on the upper parts of the Chagres River which flows into the Atlantic, is pretty enough, there being several small \*illages through which the line passes, at each of which the clearings made in the bush show the usual luxuriant tropical growth of maize, plantains, and other products ; but the flat country nearer Aspinwall is one vast swamp. The completion of the line through this is one of the most notable feats of engineering, and the passage over it recalls vividly to the mind the dismal story of the numerous deaths that occurred during the construction, the number being so great that it is said, the laying of each sleeper cost a life. Aspinwall is also built amongst the swamps, and were it not that the miasma rising round the town is blown inland by the fresh sea

At six vats to the acre this would yield 90?. per acre, with eight vats 1 20?. ; this seems a large return, but, of course, until practical experiments be made, I can only state what I believe would be the case. With three cuttings in the one season, I do not think my estimate over-sanguine. My agricultural friends in the colony will clearly understand that I am writing mainly to promote a spirit of inquiry, and a desire for intelligent experi ment. It would be very easy to find out what a given weight of green indigo will yield. The question, first of all, is to find out what weight will the land bring forth ; how many cuttings are procurable ; and then the proportion the cost of production will bear to the value and amount of the article produced. By all means let us be sure of our ground first, and not rush blindly into foolish visionary schemes. But to sum up what I have said on indigo, we have here a plant that is of immense commercial value, which is most profitably grown in India, which is hardy, quick of growth, and does not require immoderate care, or the best soil. It is strong to resist long drought and extreme heat. Quick to recover scorching, blight, or caterpillars which sometimes attack it in its earlv stages. It will not succumb to slight frosts. It is unpalatable enough to enjoy immunity from even the greedy kangaroo or omnivorous goat. It is said to be a wonderful agent in destroying miasma, and lastly it needs not to be transported in bulk, but can be manufactured where it is grown, and always commands a sale, whilst it retains its "pride of place " as the only "fast" vegetable blue the world contains, and

The money of Bonny consists of a sort of little bronze horse-shoe, called manilla, about an inch thick, and worth 25 centimes ; cowries (Cyprea moneta) are also taken, and are current throughout the basin of the Niger and Central Africa. The natives of Bonny call their country Oko loma ; their neighbours of Ebo call it Okoloba, Obani, and Ebani ; and the natives of Aboh, Osimi nuku. It appears as if Bonny was originally peopled by slaves from Ebo ; nevertheless the pre sent inhabitants have a language of their own, which is also spoken by the natives of New Calabar, a region bordering on Bonny. In spite of all precautions, and although living on pontoons, the ELiropean traders of Bonny suffer from the fatal influence of the climate. When the wind, blowing from the interior, brings the emana tions with which it is charged to the moLith of the river, an indefinable malaise takes possession of the most resolute Europeans, and if, every day at the retreat of the tide, the sea-breeze does not blow away the miasma they have been breathing and refresh the lungs, no one can resist the effects of the climate. In 1873 the sea-breeze ceased to blow for a fortnight ; there was nothing but the pesti-

And even then miasma and malarial influences are to be dreaded. A hasty walk in the morning, or an hour or two at lawn tennis, are all that you can take for exercise, and when the rain comes, and there is rain nearly every day, even this is denied you. If you live in this land of summer, you must pay a severe tribute to the sun. You become torpid and listless. Society is narrow. There are no amusements. A colony of Euro- peans, like what you see in Singapore, is a good deal like a large boarding-house at a summer resort, or a company of trav- elers at sea. You are thrown upon one another. Everybody's business is your business. Your life is not your own, but a part of other peoples' lives. You are in a state of attrition. ■ If you choose to be nervous or petulant, it is at the expense of everybody around you. Then you are not living, only sojourn- ing. Life is tinctured by gossip, and the smallest things become scandals. One part of the settlement is quarreling with the other. Nor are your associations those that ennoble and develop. Around you are races which in your heart you despise and look down upon, with whom you have no sympa- thy, whose customs are barbarism, whose religion is heathen- ism, who serve you because you have your hand on their throat. " Whenever I am with my monkey," said a European to me, " I always look him in the eye and hold a rope in my hand. If I turned my eye he might tear my arm." This is about the attitude of the European towards the Malay or the Chinaman. Those races do not respect or love, they only fear you. You are usurpers, and you are ruling them and directing their energies and their resources not for their good but for your gain. This generates indifference towards others, a tendency to tyranny in the governing, and the vices of the slave in the governed race. Human nature is not strengthened. You are in a rush to grow rich and go home. The ties of home asso- ciations are loosened, and there is a freedom of living in these Asiatic colonies that, among young men especially, produces bad results.

The mere sight of the work of Pheidias is like breathing pure health -giving air. Milton and Dante were steeped in religious patriotism ; Goethe was pervaded with philosophy, and Balzac with scien tific curiosity. Ariosto, Cervantes, and even Boccaccio are masters in the mysteries of common life. In all these cases the tone of the artist's mind is felt throughout his work : what he paints, or sings, or writes, conveys a lesson while it pleases. On the other hand, depravity in an artist or a poet percolates through work which has in it nothing positive of evil, and a very miasma of poisonous influence may rise from the appa rently innocuous creations of a tainted soul. Now Correggio is morahsed in neither way — neither as a good nor as a bad man, neither as an acute thinker nor as a deliberate volup tuary. He is simply sensuous. On his own ground he is even very fresh and healthy : his delineation of youthful maternity, for example, is as true as it is beautiful ; and his sympathy with the gleefulness of children is devoid of affecta tion. We have then only to ask ourselves whether the defect in him of all thought and feeling which is not at once capable of graceful fleshly incarnation, be sufficient to lower him in the scale of artists. This question must of course be answered according to our definition of the purposes of art. There is no doubt that the most highly organised art — that which absorbs the most numerous human qualities and effects a harmony between the most complex elements — is the noblest Therefore the artist who combines moral elevation and power of thought with a due appreciation of sensual beauty, is more elevated and more beneficial than one whose domain is simply that of carnal loveliness. Correggio, if this be so, must take a comparatively low rank. Just as we welcome the beautiful athlete for the radiant life that is in him, but bow before the personaUty of Sophocles, whose perfect form enshrined a

"So, what with fever o' mind, and yellow fever, he's food for the land crabs, that's sartain."— Capt. Marryat, R.N. (Jacob Faithful). "The foul miasma of the dying jungle, the poisonous breath of the leaves, shed from her thousand trees, and lying in every stage of decomposition around." — Florence Marryat. So far as perfection be attainable in any climate, it may be said in general terms of that of South Africa that it leaves little to be desired, and in fact arrives as near perfection as any climate can. True, if I were to speak of my own individuality, I should be inclined to take exception to this flattering character, but a man who is constitutionally opposed to even a moderate degree of heat is not in the reckoning, and I therefore fully endorse the judgment of others on this point, for I consider it to be a just and proper judgment. Sir Bartle Frere hit the right nail on the head when he said, " The climate of South Africa was generally far superior to that of the South of Europe, and reminded him of some of the best parts of the South of France, and was free from some of the drawbacks which detracted from the salubrity of the latter places ". For patients suffering from pulmonary complaints, nothing could possibly come up to the climate of South Africa. It beats the South of France by many lengths.

(11.) In support of my demand for the liberation of the officers, I have stated that we, from our point of view, are unable to acknowledge the moral right of the present Government — a Government chosen from a political party7, and devoid of all legal or firm basis — to pass sentence on and to prosecute another political party.

It should never be forgotten that the neglected presence of a single diseased creature may cause the infection of many in health, and may even ruin a whole education. V. Large saucers of chloride of lime, diluted with water and frequently stirred, should be kept in each corner of the nursery chamber during the whole education, and special attention to this precaution and ventilation is required during the last two ages, when the worms are large, and their evacuations very copious. VI. When worms are raised for reproduction, the graine should be hatched as early as possible, in order that the worm may spin its cocoon eight or ten days sooner than those raised for silk, and other worms in the neighbourhood. The object of this precaution is to escape the miasma which may possibly be conveyed by the wind from diseased nurseries. VII. Educations for reproductive purposes should always be small, and the persons entrusted with the duty should be debarred having to attend to any other nursery. VIII. The educator should bear in mind that the only cure for hereditary flacherie, or indeed for preserving the worms from the accidental form of this disease, is to give them plenty of room, to keep them individually well apart, especially during their first ages ; and that there should be a constant renewal of the air in the apartment. IX. Avoid extremes of temperature when the worms are moulting. X. The person who picks a small or diseased worm off a frame with bare fingers, should wash the hands immediately afterwards. m 2

Others, perceiving the extraordinary fertility thus obtained, followed the example, and by degrees about 300 acres of meadow, chiefly in the eastern parts of that city, but all in its immediate vicinity, and the greater part of it in the neighbourhood of the palace of Holyrood, had been systematically irrigated with the con tents of the common sewer. From some of this land so irrigated, four or five crops a year were obtained, and land once worth from 40s. to 50s. per acre let for very high sums. " This use of irrigation followed so gradually, that the time of its commencement seems not accurately ascertained, but is known to have been usual near the beginning of the present century. The tanks are still to a certain extent used. The irrigation proceeds from the beginning of April to the middle of September, and it is supposed that the deposits in the tanks are in the interval increased by the quantity of soil not employed in irrigation. " The practice was strongly objected to by the inhabitants as an offensive and injurious nuisance. To Dr. Arnott, who surveyed the district, the process appeared to be, like most offensive processes, un fitted for the vicinity of a town. The miasma from the preparation of the large accumulations of manure in open receptacles near places of pubhc resort or crowded habitations would probably affect the public health injuriously to a greater or less degree. In particular states of the weather it could scarcely fail to engender disease. In the decomposition of sub stances for manure, deleterious gases are evolved which in particular states of the atmosphere will act with powerful effects on animals within then- reach.
000650719	000650719_72	64 SANITARY AND PREVENTIVE OF DISEASE. want of drainage, if it did not necessitate, formed a strong temptation to, the use of ardent spirits. With them as with the females, the wretched condi tion of the tenement formed a strong barrier against personal cleanliness and the use of decent clothes. In the rural districts the very defects of the cottages which let in the fresh air, in spite of all the efforts of the inmates to exclude it, often obviate the effects of the overcrowding and defective ventilation. It has been observed, that while the labouring population of several districts have had no shelter but huts, similar to those described by Dr. Gilly, as the habitations of the border peasantry, which afforded a free passage for currents of air, they were not subject to fevers, though they were to rheumatism ; but when, through the good intentions of the pro prietors, such habitations were provided as were deemed more comfortable from excluding the weather effectually, but which from the neglect of ventilation afforded recesses for stagnating air and impurities which they had not the means, or had not a sufficient love of cleanliness, to remove, though rheumatism was excluded, febrile infection was generated. In the towns the access of the wind is impeded by the closeness of the surrounding habitations, and the internal construction of the dwellings tends to ex clude the air still more effectually. Were the closed windows opened, it would be frequently only to admit a worse compound, the air from neglected privies, and the miasma from the wet and undrained court or street. " The close pent up air in these abodes has, un doubtedly, a depressing effect on the nervous ener gies, and this again, with the uneducated, and indeed
000650719	000650719_73	65 OVERCROWDING IN PRIVATE HOUSES. with many of the educated workpeople, has an effect on the moral habits by acting as a strong and often irresistible provocative to the use of fermented liquors and ardent spirits. Much may be due to the incite ment of association of greater numbers of people, but it is a common fact that the same workpeople indulge more in drink when living in the close courts and lanes of the town than when living in the country, and that the residence in the different places is attended with a difference of effects similar to those described in respect to the tailors working in crowded rooms in towns, and the tailors working separately or in the country. The workpeople who have fallen into habits of drinking, strenuously allege the impossibility of avoiding the practice in such places ; they do, however, drink in greater quantities in such places and give increased effect to the noxious miasma by which they are surrounded. " Some inquiries from Mr. Liddle, the medical officer of the Whitechapel Union, as to the condition ofthe workpeople he visited in such places as he has described, brought to notice another indirect effect of the external as well as the internal condition of the dwelling on their domestic economy and general condition. "It appeared that the persons whom he visited for the purpose of administering medical relief were men earning, when in work, from sixteen to twenty shillings per week, the women earning proportionably. Yet whenever they were subjected to the frequent attacks of sickness which prevailed amongst them, they were in the most wretched destitution ; the house was bare of everything ; they had no provisions and no credit, and their need for relief was most VOL. h. 5
000650719	000650719_74	66 SANITARY AND PREVENTIVE OF DISEASE. imminent. In answer to the inquiry how this was to be accounted for, inasmuch as with agricultural labourers who earned little more than half that sum and paid nearly as much for their food, in visit ing their cottages with their ministers, there was commonly some store of provisions to be observed, Mr. Liddle stated that in such places as those in his district, in such atmospheres, a store of pro visions would not keep ; everything decayed rapidly, and the workpeople consequently lived ' from hand to mouth.' On inquiring as to this fact from a respectable butcher, accustomed to selling meat to persons living in such situations, he stated that ' meat sold on a Saturday night, in hot weather, to poor people, who have only one close room, in which they sleep, and hve, and cook, will certainly turn before the Sunday morning ; when, if it were kept in the butcher's shop, or in a well- ventilated place, it would be in as good a condition on the Monday morning. There is a great deal of loss of meat in consequence of the want of ventilation and bad con dition of the dwellings of the poorer classes. The butter kept in such places sooner becomes rancid, and the bread dry and disagreeable.' "Here, then, we have from the one agent, a close and polluted atmosphere, two different sets of effects ; the one set engendering improvidence, ex pense, and waste ; the other, the depressing effects of external and internal miasma on the nervous system, tending to incite the habitual use of ardent spirits ; and both tending to precipitate this popula tion into disease and misery. " The familiarity with the sickness and death con stantly present in the crowded and unwholesome

We have seen that local reports present similar exam ples of similar conclusions from the observation of single establishments in towns, in which reports, effects are attributed as essential to labour, of which effects that same labour is entirely divested in establishments in the county, or under other circumstances which the practitioners have had no means of observing and estimating. The various contradictory opinions on diet, and the older views on the innocuousness of miasma, are commonly referable to the circumstances under which the medical observers were placed ; and examples abound in every district of the errors in cidental to narrow ranges of observation in cases perplexed by idiosyucracies, and by numerous and varying antecedents. It should be understood by the public that the value of hospital and dispensary practice consists in the range of observation they give ; and that the extent of observation or oppor tunities of medical knowledge are influenced or governed by administrative arrangements. In several of the medical schools of the Metropolis, however, the opportunities of knowledge are dependent on the cases which may chance to arise there. " Fortunate administrative arrangements have in Paris greatly advanced medical knowledge by bring ing large classes of cases under single observation. The most important discoveries made with respect to consumption, those made by M. Louis, were based on the results of the post-mortem examinations of nearly 1,300 cases by that one practitioner. Nearly all the important conclusions deduced from this extensive range of observations were at variance with his own previous opinions and the opinions that

If a man pays a shilling a week, as he generally does in London, for his coal for warming his one room in winter, nearly one-third, or fourpence, would be wasted through a thin window. Now, this waste of heating-power would compensate for getting a thick glass or double one. Moreover, a very thick window is very difficult to cut or break through, and may, with a curtain, save the expense of shutters. Ventilation. "But having got the house weather-tight, and damp-proof, and miasma-proof, with washable and non-absorbent walls, we shall, nevertheless, if we have them closed almost hermeticaUy, have only placed the population in small crowded rooms, under a set of inverted receivers of vitiated and phthisis producing air and — if the crowding is intense — fever producing air. It is, therefore, proposed, as most important heads of sanitary specification for ventila tion, that the construction shall be such : — " 1. As to change the air of each living and sitting-room completely, not less frequently than three times an hour. 2. As to change the vitiated air for air that is warm as well as fresh. 3.

Neverthe less, culture and high farming is frequently conducted in a manner productive of noxious emanations that are injurious to health, and make the culture there a nuisance. This is done by heavy top dress ings of what is called ' town manure,' in the solid form, in which condition it remains stagnating until it is disintegrated by decomposition, by which de composition its fertilising power is diminished, and it is then carried down into the soil by the rain. The complete remedy of this evil is to liquefy the manure at once — to put it in solution, and apply it to the soil in doses proportioned to the soil's re ceptivity — in fact, to apply it as sewage, by which means one load of stable manure may be made to do the work of more than two. I was advised, when I looked into the subject, that the waste of the farm yard manures and other manures, by the methods the farmers used, was in extensive districts equivalent to another rental. On the other hand, it was pointed out in our instructions that applications of plain water in excess, by the method of submersion, creating marsh surfaces and marsh miasma, were often conducive to the rot in sheep and ague in men ; and, of course, that the distribution of sewage in the like manner would be productive of still worse results. At the irrigations at Paris, as I am in formed, this danger has been incurred, through excessive submersion, by the nnskilfulness of the small farmers to whom the sewage has been given, and that sewage, not in the fresh state, but as sewage of a bad quality, as nearly all there is.

The warmth of the climate had finally become so intense as to affect the health of the people ; more especially were the children sickened by the deadly miasmas that filled the air. Fever and pestilence prevailed, and men created for a differ ent and cooler clime could not sustain the noxious vapors and debilitating heat. They were literally driven from the garden no longer adapted to their want.1 The flora and fauna of the country had for a long time been changing. The vegetation of the temperate zone had disappeared, and had been replaced by that of the semi-tropical and torrid zones. The beasts, birds, reptiles, and insects of the hot climates had taken possession of the woods, plains, rivers, and jungles. The various discomforts caused by them, with the increasing heat, caused a strong and general movement from the central and southern portions of India ; and large numbers sought a more temperate clime. Passing out of India, they turned westward along the shores of the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, until the fertile valley of the Euphrates arrested their course. Still larger numbers from southern India arrived by means of vessels, at the same 1 It is a well-known fact, that the children born in India of English parents cannot live in the climate : their parents are obliged to send them to England to preserve their lives.

Its damp atmosphere, moreover, especi ally after sunset, exposes it to fevers. In winter it is sometimes cold ; snow being not unknown, while fuel is scarce. Great mounds of dung stretch along outside the city wall, to be used as fuel for heating baths and ovens, showing that wood is not to be easily had. In the height of summer, the prevalent uncleanness of the streets, as well as the decay of vegetation, poisons the air with miasma; the services of hordes of town dogs, which eat up all kinds of carrion and garbage, alone preventing a periodical visit of the plague. There are various " quarters " in the city, as in other Oriental towns. That of the Jews still lies, as in the days of the apostles, near " the street which is called Straight,"1 originally a noble avenue, with a broad road in the middle, and a line of portico, like that of the Rue Rivoli in Paris, at each side. Now, however, only the portico on one side is open ; 'the remainder being covered with houses or otherwise enclosed, although the great triple gate at one end of the street shows the original design. Some of the houses in the Jews' quarter, though mean enough externally, are wonderfully fine within. One of them showed what the mansion of a rich Oriental is like, better even than the rich houses I had already seen. At the outer entrance, a doorkeeper had his quarters, opening the wooden gate only after repeated knockings, like the porter who watches the gate in the parable of our Lord.2 The court, when entrance was finally gained, proved to be paved with polished slabs of basalt, marble, and other costly stones. A fountain, and a flowing stream, with shrubs and trees, cooled the air. Round the open space rose the walls of the mansion, 1 Acts ix. 11. 2 Mark xiii. 34.

There could hardly be a greater contrast of climate than that presented between these two great districts. On the northern side the mountains concentrate the humidity from the Caspian ; fog and clouds are frequent ; the moisture is deposited in heavy and frequent rains, and numerous streams leap down the precipices of the rocky Elburz and meander across the alluvial plains that border the sea. This abundance of humidity produces a wonderful vege tation, perennial in loveliness, and almost tropical in its variety and luxuriance. The roads wind through a noble underwood of primeval forests of extraordinary density and beauty, whose venerable trees are clothed with the velvet of emerald mosses, or embraced by the tendrils of clambering lianas. Often the green gloom of the woods is brightened by the vivid scarlet blossoms of the wild pomegranate, gleaming like glints of fire ; and the glades echo with the music of dashing streams. Near the sea the wilderness gives place to cultivated orchards, or to spacious lawns and vistas of barley-fields, old granges, and thatched huts of the peasantry nestling under superb masses of pendulous foliage, by the edge of steaming rice-fields. But the stranger, however fascinated he may be with the charms of one of the loveliest regions on the globe, is warned to be on his guard, to carry with him rifle and quinine, and not to tarry there except in the early springtime. For in those forests lurk the panther and the tiger, the frequent and persistent mosquito, and the venomous serpent ; while the deadly miasma floats like a spirit of evil over those rice-fields, and few there be who are not wasted or slain by the all-pervading fever. But as one begins to reach the upper shelves of the mountains he becomes aware that he is entering upon scenery so different, that, although the transition is made in a few hours, he seems to have arrived in a region far distant from the one that he has

Naturally, I cannot vouch for the authenticity of such in formation ; but, notwithstanding this, it is interesting to repeat such tales. He also told me of a tribe, which he called Shimbam wuneni. This people lived still farther to the west. The Maravi, his own tribesmen, he said, could not understand them. For example, he spoke of them saying memo, for water, the Maravi word being madzi. Further he related how he had travelled on the northern side of the great valley of the Zambesi ; north of Zumbo, among two tribes, called, respectively, Siankope and Siam wenda. Not the least interesting portion of this wanderer's intelligence was the news that, when boys were being recruited, the Tette people said : "Ah, don't go with the Igrezi [English], they eat people!" I tried to explain, as best as I could, to the man and his friends that the white race — the Igrezi — were the first to repress the traffic of slavery, which existed in his country ; they were the liberators of the black slave, and his best friends among all the nations of the world. Just before beginning the ascent of the Kapirizange range, I had seen tsetse fly ; but in the mountains none were to be found. Oh, beloved mountains, where the wind blows fresh and free, laden with no poison from the miasma of swamp rotting in the great river valleys ! Most intense was my feeling of delight, while listening to the gentle zephyrs rustling through the branches which waved beside our new camp, and making the leaves of the tall palms tremble like restless pennants. Although we had ascended only about 600 feet, that is to say, but one step of the rugged ladder

Continuing his remarks, he informed us that the day before he had sent an old man, " who had talked " across the river to them, and they had said : " We will not fight you now ; but eat and grow fat, we want you next year." Neither M. Giraud nor my7self thought it necessary or desirable to linger ; in fact, we bad already agreed that I should go ahead to speak with the Portuguese, and there and then we told the chief that such would be our course. I took Fred with me, also the patriarch " who had talked " and had been the ambassador of the previous day. Starting on our mission, we .trudged over the dusty foot worn lanes that led to the river. Ere long the path was lost in the thick belts of water-cane and other rank vegeta tion which fringe the river's brink. A loud noise of. many voices in the rear made me look backward. I was followed by a small army ! Not without great difficulty could the people be persuaded to return and leave me to make my way in peace, for I was nearing the river, and did not know what the state of hostilities might be. I also remembered that no white man was expected by the Portuguese outposts. I kept a sharp look-out ; but no sooner had I got into the reeds than down I went, deep into the false mud. Imme diately before this involuntary plunge I saw a man with a gun dodging about, with the evident intention of hiding from me. Just as I sank into the first pit I challenged the man ; but he was off. I was nearly choked by the vile miasma that thickened the suffocating air, for the heat of the blazing sun was slowly and surely making the rotting reeds exhale the foulest gases that ever poisoned man.

If the Tricolour and the Leviathan kept together, un necessary delay would arise, so that the best plan would be to divide what trifling supplies were left, and each find the course as well and as quickly as possible to Mazaro. My share in the grand division was a tin of pea-soup. Giraud's Wangwana men, poor creatures, suffered most, owing to their religious scruples forbidding them to eat that which they had not themselves killed, or to dip in a dish with others not of their own kin. Each canoe strikes out on its own account, and before two miles had been covered they part. Ahead is the false mirage drawn across the southern sky like a landscape curtain. Such views dissolve suddenly. The optical illusion dies before the eyes. The current changes. It now flows from west to east, and for the second time I find myself buoyed along on the strong bosom of the Zambesi. Astern, far away, stretches the peaceful savannah, cut by the silvery and sinuous lines of the converging streams. From these putrefying wastes rises the deadly malaria, invisible, and yet invincible as the mightiest forces of the dread unknown. These vast tracts defy the puny skill and strength of man; no mortal power can subdue or remove the poison of their miasma. I remember well the wild fierceness of the heat upon that memorable day when we floated into the wide Zambesi. Under the terrible rage of the noonday sun all vegetation withered and wasted, as quickly as though cast into a

" I have found throughout my tour, what all English travellers must find — that slavery is a question which it is better not to go out of one's way to discuss. For, although I have had many friendly conversations with its most ardent supporters and most violent opponents, I soon discovered, on the one hand, that the question is practically compromised by the great political parties in the Free States, from time to time, in order to conciliate Southern votes ; and, on the other, that the slave-owners consider the word ' abolition ' as synonymous with confiscation and civil war. The latter meet you at the outset of the argument by stating that their whole property consists of land and slaves. That their lands of course derive their value from cultivation ; and that, apart from the mere question of cost, that cultivation is impossible in the hands of the white man. They tell you, that while the negro endures the labour of the rice field mid-leg deep in water, and with a scorching sun above his head, without danger, and can withstand the miasma hanging in the night air on the plantations — the white man is attacked with hopeless fever if he exposes himself to these influences. They declare that the unconditional abolition of slavery, in a country abounding in unappropriated lands, where men may squat without being disturbed, means simply the con fiscation of three hundred millions sterling, the value of the slaves, in the first place, and the abandondment

About four miles short of the Percall is a large expanse of rice-fields irrigated from the lake, the supply from which flows through a sluice into a wide channel known as the Cummumait nullah, the surplus water of which, combined with many other streams, flows eastward into the Kistnah river. In the dense jungles which surround the Percall lake are tigers, bears, spotted deer, in short, all kinds of wild animals which are found in Southern India ; but better sport is to be had in the more cultivated tracts which are near the few villages of this wild district. Heavy jungles do not hold so much game as more open spaces, where forest and cultivation are intermixed ; also, the Percall lake and its thick forests, which extend, in miles and miles of wilderness, as far as tbe Godavery, is to be approached with caution. A deadly miasma pervades that wild country for the greater part of the year ; indeed, the only safe season is tbe dry hot weather from February to May or the beginning of June, when the jungles are comparatively healthy and free from malarious influences. For the return journey to Secunderabad another route may be taken with advantage, by Terragopla, Nagpore (a small jungle village), and Koolpac, and so by Rama ram and Kaissera to the cantonments. All along this route good shooting may be had. At Terragopla there

In the Shih-doze, i.e., "Head, of Snow," Buddhist Monastery, May 1th. Yesterday evening, in the mellow light of a full moon, we started for the river, where the Mission boat lay ready for us. The night was so beautiful that we sorely grudged being obliged to sleep, but having a long day before us, we resolutely turned in, soon after we had passed the Bridge of Boats (one of which slips out to let us through). These form a bridge two hundred yards long. When we awoke at daybreak we were about twenty miles from Ning po, and were nearing the village of Kong-ke'o, where we anchored just above an extraordinary bridge supported on piers formed by clusters of separate upright stones. It is covered in with woodwork, and has a tiled roof and shops at either end — such an eccentric-looking concern ! Here we found the people extremely civil, thanks to the humanising influence of the American Mission, which has had a station here for some years, and a neat church. After early breakfast, we started in chairs, with two servants and six luggage coolies, on a further expedition of twenty miles to the Snowy Valley. Our route lay through a pretty country, chiefly agricultural. The people were planting out their rice, which, being first sown in one thick mass, is thence transplanted, when a few inches high, to the large fields. I can fancy no more unpleasant task than rice planting in all its stages, as it involves standing up to the knees in soft mud, and usually inhaling a damp miasma. But to the mere spectator, the exquisite green of growing

On Monday we explored enough of Tien-tsin to satisfy me that I had no wish to see more of it, though it is a very important commercial city, being the port of Peking, and moreover a great walled town, with a population of about 950,000 persons. But though our active chair-coolies carried us over the ground very briskly, we saw nothing in our three hours of sight-seeing, under a blazing sun, to redeem the general dusty ugliness. Everything seemed alike hideous, and I have as yet seen no town to compare with this for dirt, dust, beat, and bad smells. On all sides open sewers send up a steaming miasma, and a very large proportion of the people are terribly scarred by small-pox, which periodically rages here ; and the people take no precautions against infection, unless inoculating children, and then administering a most disgusting drug as a sort of charm, can rank as such. Most of our way lay between hot dry dull walls, which perhaps enclosed luxurious homes of rich men, but we saw only the dreary exterior, thronged by wretched beggars in every stage of poverty and disease. The whole city, as well as every village I have yet seen in the north, is built of mud, only varied by an occasional house of grey mud bricks. The only point of relief to the eye is that here, as in the south, the bulk of the population are clothed in blue, and moreover here many women wear bright-coloured clothes, and look very clean and neat. Another feature is the multitude of donkeys and mules which stand in the streets ready saddled for hire, and are much patronised by the sailors of the numerous foreign ships, both commercial and

At the first turning of the river, a circular wall presents itself upon the right, which encloses an image of the Virgin, the principal deity of the Catholics, and more especially the patroness of those v\nose bread is cast upon the waters. Sometimes an old man may be seen to cross his breast in token of reverence as he passes ; but it is a rare thing with one of this unbelieving sex. The Avomen, hoAvever, almost always make the holy sign ; their lips move ; occasionally they sink upon their knees, and bend their head. In the curve of a creek close by is the Houssiniere, an antique-looking building, set dovAm in a very romantic situation, and appropriated to the dignified leisure of the prefects of the department. On the other side of the river is a rock without any thing remarkable in its appearance, although the vieAv from the top is fine. It is called, or rather miscalled, the Rocher d'Enfer. ToAArards the north of the Houssiniere the httle river Cens falls into the Erdre, and forms a bay, the surface of which is covered Avith aquatic plants, which in summer, having scarcely Avater enough to sustain them, exhale their complaints in the form of miasma. Beyond the bay, on the left bank of the river, are the ruins of a chateau, surrounded by lofty trees. Let us noAV borrow for an instant the pen of a native of Nantes, whose book is frequently an agreeable companion.1 " The imagination," says he, " having nothing to excite it, we sink into a reverie made up more of sensations than ideas.

In 1537, Marguerite de Valois, the celebrated Queen of Navarre, spent some months hi this retreat ; and as she was accustomed to amuse herself with Avriting in her journeys, the banks of the Erdre, in all probability, in spired some of her tales. After passing several country houses, Ave get a glimpse of the bourg of Suce, a place as ancient as the days of Barbe-Torte, the conqueror of the Normans. It is situated in the manner of a sea-port, at the bottom of a creek, the sides of which are lofty, and covered with a thick foliage. On the opposite, or left bank of the Erdre, are the remains of an ancient seignorial chateau, which* served as a country residence of the bishops. The principal gate is still pre served entire; and, standing on the summit of a conical rock, it presents a very picturesque appearance. At Mazerolles the scene changes. The river widens, and the low banks, covered with mist, are faintly seen in the distance. In the twilight, when the shore is only half visible or altogether escapes the eye, one might imagine himself upon the ocean. The plain of waters appears illimitable ; the silence is intense ; and the river so black, so heavy, so sthiess, that you may fancy it the Dead Sea. In the midst of this noiseless solitude, there are two islands — the only islands hi the whole course of the river. One of these is thickly wooded, and covered with the vine of Saint Denis. There wTas found in it, below the surface of the ground, a canoe formed of the trunk of a single tree, in the manner of savages. The second island boasts of one tree — but this is an old oak, whose branches sustain an image of the Holy Virgin.

One of this idustrious half-dozen alone weighed sixty-eight ! The strange thine: is. that these enormous vegetables preserve no analogy with the animal Kingaom under such circum stances, but keep their proper flavour amidst ad their excess of groAvth. The potato, however, is an exception to this rule. It groAvs, hke the rest, to a colossal size ; but, in a sod so different from that of its natural hard and stony bed, it contracts a taste of soap. The agricultural implements used in the marsh are very unlike, as we may suppose, those of other districts. The spade, for instance, which is employed in turning over earth that presents no resistance, is almost as large in pro portion as the fruits of the sod. The beds are generady intersected at every fifteen feet of width by ditches, or drains, of six feet. But whde the principle of vegetable life developes itself so vigorously, that of human life declines. The miasma of the marsh is fatal ; and in autumn more espe cially, or in the intense heats of summer, the victims are numerous. The disease produced is a sIoav fever, AAdiich varies in malignity with the state of the atmosphere, but for Avhich there is no hope in medicine. Doctors, notAAnth standing, are called as usual; drugs are swallowed; and the patient descends into the tomb secundum artem. The fresh tints of the women of Quidebœuf are here unknown. Sallow complexions, spiritless eyes, and feeble limbs, demonstrate the deadly influence of the marsh. Almost every girl you meet is an orphan — every Avoman a Avidow.

On descending into this rich valley, we found a sensible change in the temperature, which became still more observable every step we advanced towards Olympia. The south wind and noonday sun added to the inconvenience. There was no glass to the windows of the khan : but, closing all available shutters, we set ourselves to rest as seriously as was possible in the face of countless flies and other greater annoyances. The whole of this district had laboured under this mala sama from time immemorial ; and, to calm the torment of flies, it was not thought unworthy to recur to the intervention of the highest and strongest. It was a dignus vindice nodus for a Jupiter Tonans, or a lion-killing Hercules. The plague has assur edly not diminished, since the overthrow of their altars : it remains with other evils, such as miasma and fever. Many years ago, on visiting this same country, and sleeping in the open gallery of a khan over Olympia, in the month of June, one of our servants caught a fever of which he died the year after. Paying deference, therefore, and not without reason, to the genius loci, we remained tranquilly here until the cooler hours of tbe after noon allowed us to remount our steeds. Our ride lay through a beautifully variegated shrubbery, over gently undulating ground, along the precipitous banks of the winding Alpheus. Within half an hour from the khan, descending to the lower land, we reached the sandy beach of the river Ladon. The Ladon, issuing from the high

Our passengers also found some bargains in other linen goods and under clothing ; and their wardrobes were sensibly improved, without corres ponding benefit to Uncle Samuel's customs revenue. At mid-day, the long and crowded passenger train started Across the Isthmus, — treasure and baggage waited for a second, — and we had that ever-memora ble ride, in the experience of all who have ever made this trip, between the Continents, from ocean to ocean, in the very fullness of the tropics, over rails fairly built upon human bodies, so fatal was the miasma of the country to nearly all classes of imported laborers. The road is fifty miles long, and the run is made in two to three hours. Mo nopolizing the commerce of all the Pacific Coast of both North and South America, the gateway for all travel from Continent to Continent, it is a rich pos session to its owners. The fare for this two hours' ride is no less than twenty-five dollars, and freights are correspondingly high. The sleepers and ties of the track are of lignum-vitæ wood, the telegraph posts of cement, as thus only are both protected from rot and insect. The road is well appointed in other respects, and the service unexceptionable. But the ride was rare revelation. All was sub stantially new and strange to our unused northern eyes; and we stared and wondered and absorbed through all this tropical passage. The sun was not fierce ; one will suffer more from heat in a ride from Springfield to New York of a dry and dusty August day ; but the warmth was deep and high,— it lay in

At a distance they look' more like airy dove-cots than baskets full of human beings. Lovely as is the situation, the inhabitants of Banias look wretched, pallid, and yellow, and the very infant at the breast has ague stamped on its face. Many of the women have fine features, but are haggard and worn from the effects of the deadly miasma Avhich rises in autumn from tbe marshes of Huleh. The people are a quiet harmless set, neither carrying arms, nor inflicting on others the necessity for carrying them. LaAV and order reign.

But there is one thing that impresses Banias more deeply on the heart than its beauty, its ruins, or its natural history. Into the coasts of Cæsarea Philippi our Bedeemer came. Among these rocks St. Peter confessed His divinity — that confession Avhich was the " Eock of the Church." Six days at least did He sojourn here. From hence He took the chosen three up into that mountain of Hermon bejiind, and was transfigured before them. Here Avas set that wondrous seal to the resurrection of the body, as well as to His Godhead. Here His work of teaching was nearly finished. Hence He set His face for the last time to go up to Jerusalem, and here unfolded His coming passion.

The cattle increase with but slight care, and wealth is still comparatively valueless; for when the native has gained enough for the pur chase of the long sword in its silver scabbard, the bit, stirrups, and spurs, all of silver, and the bridle and saddle, profusely ornamented with silver dol lars, his ambition is gratified; and on gala days he appears well mounted, with embroidered shirt flut tering outside his other garments, his naked feet adorned with the precious spurs, and thrust into the equally precious stirrups, — content to employ his brief hour in useless display, and then lay aside shirt and ornaments, for his daily avocation of swinging in the hammock.

Upon the rivers, during the rainy season, the sul triness is indescribable. Insects torment the body, and utter idleness corrodes the mind.

I then wrote orders for my second in command, containing full instructions what to do in case of my not returning in a stated time, and also a letter to the Com modore, to be forwarded if any mishap occurred. At 4 a.m. next morning I left the ship in my gig, accompanied by Mr. S. (the before-mentioned young officer), whom I put in charge of the second gig. We took our revolvers, the boats' crews their cutlasses. At Me Call's wharf the traders joined us in their boats. These gentle men were not by any means enamoured of the trip, but I took them with me as a sort of security, as from the fact of their regularly paying " cumy " or tax to the kings, they would be in a certain degree respected. At a little before 5 a.m. we started ; it was a lovely and, for the coast, a cool morning, and as the flood tide had just commenced we spun up the river at a famous rate. The only thing wanting was a break in the monotony of the scenery. With the exception of the river, nothing was to be seen but the dark-green mangrove bushes, absolutely alive with parrots, avadavats, cranes, and other African birds, diversified occasionally by a troop of monkeys, who chattered away at us at a fine rate. Every now and then a long snout would be poked out of the bush, and with a heavy sullen plunge an alligator would make his appearance, and at one turn in the river we saw, hanging from a bough, a boa of about twelve or fourteen feet long, and as thick as a man's upper arm. The depth of the river varied much, in some places we found it as much as ten or eleven fathoms*

After leaving this point the river became a mere shallow muddy creek, edged as before with mangrove. The sickening and almost overpowering miasma that arose from the dense swamps of decayed and decaying vegetable matter was ter rific, and heartily glad was I that I had not subjected any of my English crew to its influence. Ten miles more and the creek suddenly shoaled so much that the Kroomen had to get out and drag the boats through the soft mud, until we arrived at the town of Obulhambra, which we reached soon after half-past ten o'clock. Our unexpected appearance created a great commotion, and an immense quantity of "jabber and jaw." We landed and proceeded to the "Ju ju " house or temple, and I sent my interpreter to inform the king who I was, and to request his attendance on his brother king and myself at a " Palaver," to be held in the " Ju-ju " house at Bassambra, the other town, at 1 p.m. Obulhambra, like all African towns, is a dirty, stinking hole, but the huts were better built than any I had seen on the sea coast. We only remained there long enough to drink a calibash of " tumbo " or palm wine with his Majesty King " Arishma," who very quickly waited on me. He is a splendid specimen of the true negro, fully six feet high and formed like an Achilles. He bears among the traders a very good character, which is much more than King Kayo of Bassam bra does. I invited him into my boat, and we proceeded about half-a-mile further up the creek to Bassambra, which is the best African town I had seen. It is built on the banks of the river and has a strong stockade all round it, except on
000273588	000273588_142	135 LEAVES FROM MY LOG. who made a blow at my head with the stock of his musket. I, however, turned it with my cutlass, and giving him "point three" just over the navel disposed of him. The other two canoes had by this time disappeared, and on towing the one we had taken alongside, I found she was a Brass canoe, and that there were seven wounded and three dead negoes in her, and from one of the former I found she had left Brass before my visit, and consequently did not know that a man-of-war was in the river. One of them was only slightly hurt, so next morning I seized him up and gave him " three dozen," and then landed him to find his way back, desiring him to tell the king I should keep the other six men until they were cured, when, after a similar dose, I would land them, and this, by the way, I religiously carried out. It was now time to weigh. Day was breaking, but the morning fog hung like a pall over the river, and as the fitful gusts of the " terral " or land breeze came off loaded with heavy, sickly miasma, an indescribable feeling of nausea came over one, which took a strong dose of quinine to get over. Angama is only a few miles above Opuhpuroma, and we anchored off the Ju-ju house before breakfast I had sent a canoe up to inform the king I was coming, so our advent did not cause any alarm, and almost as we let go the anchor a large canoe came alongside with the king's son, who said he was sent by his father to greet the stranger and present him with a small dash of fruit, fish, and eggs, and to offer him a house, food, and -wives. These, of course (with the exception of the latter), I accepted, and I returned a suitable dash of slave cloth, velvet, and rum, with a request that his majesty would pay me a visit on " trade palava."

It ought to be remembered with gratitude, by the Hindus of Benares and Northern India generally, that the British Government of India, instead of pursuing the destructive and prohibitive policy of the Moham medan rulers, has taken the Eanchkosi road under its own charge, and, in a spirit of beneficence deserving of the highest praise, defrays the expenses of its annual repairs. It would be a happy circumstance if Benares itself received the same proportion of attention as this road around it. Threaded with narrow streets, above which rise the many-storied edifices for which the city is famous, it is, without doubt, a problem of con siderable difficulty, how to preserve the health of its teeming population. But, when we reflect on the foul wells and tanks in some parts of the city, whose water is of deadly influence, and the vapour from which fills the air with fever-fraught and cholera-breeding miasma; when we consider the loathsome and disgust ing state of the popular temples, owing to the rapid decomposition of the offerings, from the intense heat of the sun; when we call to mind the filthy condition of nearly all the by-streets, due to stagnant cesspools, accumulated refuse, and dead bodies of animals ; and when, in addition, we remember how utterly re-

It admits every kind of shrub, plant, and flower into a close com- panionship, where they intermingle each other's luxu- riant stalks, where they twist and twine each other's long slender arms about one another, and defy the utmost power of sun to penetrate the leafy tangle they have reared ten to fifteen feet above the dank earth. This is the bush into which the Ashantee warriors creep on all fours, and lie in wait in the gloomy recesses for the enemy." Mists and miasma add to the difficulty of advance in the awful jungle depths. In their journey from the coast to Coomassie the British had, time after time, to cut a path for themselves. League after league was covered by men advancing in Indian file. They never knew what the bushes were hiding — a wild beast of the forest or a desperate, naked Ashantee. One instruction was that if, during the advance through the bush, fire was unexpectedly opened by the enemy concealed behind cover, the men must immediately drop on the knee behind trees or any cover that might be at hand, pausing well before delivering their fire, and taking care to shoot low at the spot from which the enemy were seen to fire.

The flower plots, containing the much cherished roses, dahlias, daisies, &c, resemble, if they do not surpass, equally well-attended plots in Great Britain. Pumpkins and all the melon species are easily grown, and many of them, as the rock and water melon, are good substitutes for fruit. ' What a fine country Australia would be if provided with navigable rivers ! ' is a frequent remark. Yet, if there were many navigable rivers, it would not be the remarkable healthy country it is ; whilst there would be none of that pure, balmy atmosphere which we feel to be one of the greatest luxuries of human existence. There are no stagnant marshes, or at least very few, to hold and drink in the rain as it falls and to serve as feeders of streams. There are therefore no poisonous exhalations to create a miasma in the atmosphere ; to breed the many ills to which flesh is heir. Slight showers of rain are not of frequent occurrence : as a rule, when rain falls, it falls in ' bucketsful.' Creeks, upon which nearly all the country is dependent for supplies of water, are the great reservoirs ; they abound everywhere, between

Nearly the whole country consists of little more than a close con glomeration of these hills, all of them clothed in the brightest green, a tropical character being given to the scene by the rich banana plantations which frequently cover their sides. Here again, however, the pleasant impression is shaken on closer inspection by the discovery that, except where its place is taken by the banana gardens, this wealth of verdure consists, not of growing crops and luxuriant cultivation, but of an impervious tangle of tall elephant grass, twelve to sixteen feet in height, whose close-growing cane-like stems offer an effective barrier to the comfortable progress of almost any living creature except an elephant or a field-mouse. It is, moreover, unpleasant to realise that between each hill and its neighbour lies an unwholesome -looking swamp, through the centre of which a sluggish stream of slimy water languidly struggles with the obstacles offered to its progress by dense masses of rushes, papyrus, and other rank and matted products of the marsh. With a sigh of perplexity as he passes from the tangled waste through the carefully -tended and fruit laden banana grove, from the bright air of the hillside to the death-dealing miasma of the fœtid swamp, the traveller as he raises his eyes towards the evening

They took a westerly course along the coast, with the idea of reaching the River of Palms and the Spanish settlements in Mex ico — which on the maps of the time had been inaccu rately placed — believing they would be less exposed than by striking out across the Gulf; but notwith standing this caution the company was destined to destruction, and misfortune met it on every hand. Narvaez, separated from his crew, which had gone ashore, was swept out to sea in a violent storm and never seen again. De Vaca's party, and those of Cas tillo and Dorantes, were shipwrecked upon the Island of Santa Rosa, where nearly all perished; while those who were with Enriquez and Juan Suarez suffered the most terrible privations and at last they too mis erably perished. The ninety six men in the boats commanded by Captains Tellez and Penalosa, going ashore near Pass Christian for water and provisions, were killed by the natives, who could easily overcome them, so weak had they become bodily and in numbers. There were now only four survivors of that great expedition which a short time before had left the Bay of the True Cross believing their arms irresistible and their success assured; these were De Vaca, Castillo, Dorantes, and the Moor Estevanico. Through the inevitable changes of a life among a strange and half-

It is the damp night air which prevads in the lowlands, and its attendant miasma, wliich proves so fatal. One after another of the European overseers and engineers sickened, and were compeded to return home to England before a resto ration to health was effected ; whde some, apparently the most hardy, and who took the best of care of themselves, succumbed altogether, and were buried in the island far from their native land. Better drain age and cleared jungles have greatly improved the sanitary conditions. The dense forest has been opened to the influence of purifying breezes and the effect of the genial sunshine, so that there is much less chance for the pestdence to find a breeding-place. Banana groves, with the trees bending under the weight of the rich, finger-shaped fruit ; tad cocoanut trees, the tops heavy with the nutritious food they bear ; stout tamarinds and juicy mangoes ; ant-hids, looking like young volcanoes, half as high as native huts ; rippling cascades ; sharp declivities ; glisten ing pools ; white cranes ; tall pink flamingoes, stand ing like sentinels on the muddy banks ; an occasional monkey leaping among the trees ; golden orioles, gaudy-feathered parrots, and other birds of dazzling hues, are observed with never-flagging interest from the windows of the slowly moving cars, while on this inland route to Kandy.

The hot and stifling atmosphere, laden with miasma, plays terrible havoc with the health and strength of the white man. He lounges idly about the deck, longing in vain for a breath of pure sea air, the humid atmosphere pressing upon him so heavily that it is difficult to breathe, and almost impossible to work. The wily traders know all this. They visit the ship, and are profuse in apologies, explanations, and promises ; but day after day passes and but little is added to the cargo, while the men sicken one after another with a rapidity which becomes alarming. The traders board the ship less frequently, and ivory and palm-oil arrive in less and less quantities, until, in despair at the expenses he is incurring, and fearing the loss of his entire crew if he stays longer, the captain weighs anchor and sails away. This has been the history of many a ship which has voyaged from Europe to the Gaboon, illustrating the truth of the old proverb which says that he is a bad paymaster who pays beforehand. The ship we have just seen anchor in the river will doubtless suffer a similar fate. The captain paces the deck, throwing impatient glances at either bank of the river, hoping to see laden canoes putting off; but it is hoping against hope, for none dot the water, and no signs are perceptible of any work going on on shore. At length, from a little creek, hidden by dense vegeta tion from all on board, a light canoe shoots out and "jnakes its way to the vessel, in which is recognised a native trader, who presently climbs the side and presents himself before the captain.

There is another danger to which the unwary desert traveller is exposed. Those who have journeyed through such boundless tracts of sand report that at evening, when the tents are pitched, and preparations are made for the night, if one roams away from the camp he may chance to hear the sound of a bell, so melodious that he is irresistibly drawn to the direction from whence it comes, and wanders on and on till he finds he has lost himself. Becoming bewildered in his endeavours to retrace his steps, he strays still further away, until exhausted, he sinks down upon the hard sands, and dies iu the midst of an awful silence, with no friendly hand to close his sightless eyes. Khartum is the principal centre of traffic in Nubia, and the point to which all the caravan routes converge ; it is built on the left bank of the Blue Nile. Facing the river are the Government Houses and the residence of the Governor-General of the province. Many of the streets look down from a bluff height, the houses being white washed, while here and there are extensive gardens of orange and citron trees. Stately palms add their share to the pleasant appearance of the town, and the mosque and minaret rise above the roof's of the houses. A closer acquaintance dispels a little of the charm of the place, for the streets are narrow and badly drained, while pools of water, made in the rainy season, are redolent of deadly miasma. The inhabitants, 40,000 in number, are of various nationalities — Nubians, Jews, Egyptians, Gallas, Negroes, Turks, Greeks, and others; added to which is a regiment of the Shillooks — of jet black hue and warlike character — in the service of the Government.

We heard the wild boar breaking through the thicket, but not one left the pro tecting cover ; only some purple herons floated languidly over our heads. I endeavoured to get out of this horrible place as quickly as possible, for I felt that I had already inhaled too much of the marsh miasma and the odours of decaying matter. By evening I had to experience its further ill consequences. The Grand Duke, too, soon came back from the other side of the morass, driven away by the foul air ; so we mounted the horses which the excellent Ferdinand had brought after us and rode homewards. We repeatedly scared the frankolin in the long sedge, and killed several of them. Riding over the grass of the steppe, I wished to try how quickly a conflagration could be started, and accordingly dropped some lighted matches as I rode along. In a few seconds there was a great fire, which spread so rapidly that we were obliged to gallop from it as hard as possible. The next day we could see from a distance that part of the steppe still wrapped in clouds of smoke. We quickly got back to Baisan, whither the other gentlemen had also returned with some game. After luncheon some Egyptian rope-dancers, who were travelling that way, performed before us. Amongst many other more or less unsuccessful conjuring tricks, we had the bee-dance, so familiar to us in Egypt, executed by a woman on a rope. In the afternoon we all again left the camp, and dispersed among the high sword-grass by the village, among which the frankolin had been making its voice heard the whole day.

It is cooler in summer than any other portion of Florida, and in fact the thermometer does not range so high as in New York city. It is peculiarly adapted for, and at no dis tant day will become, a popular health resort, or sanitarium, for those afflicted with bronchial or pulmonary affections, rheuma tism, neuralgia, dyspepsia, nervous exhaustion, etc. The best route, especially for invalids, is by steamer via Key West. But it is not for the invalid alone that this region has attrac tions and advantages, but for the tourist, the sportsman, the lover of adventure, and the settler as well. The country from Miami to Cape Sable is known as the Indian Hunting Grounds, and abounds in game of all kinds common to the climate, and where it roams almost uudisturbed. The Everglades will always retain its present state of wildness, and thus furnish a safe re treat for game animals, where they will multiply and increase in spite of the advance of civilization. The singular and wonderful region known as the Everglades is not, as is popularly supposed, an impenetrable swamp, exhal ing an atmosphere of poisonous gases aud deadly miasma, but a charming, shallow lake of great extent, with pure and limpid waters from a few inches to several feet in depth, in which grow curious water-grasses and beautiful aquatic plants ; while thou sands of small islands, from a few rods to a hundred acres in ex tent, rise from the clear waters, clothed with never-endintr verdure and flowers ; while cypress and crab-wood, sweet-bay and palmetto, cocoa-plum and cocoa-palm, water and live-oaks,

"VTYANGWE has been well chosen by the Zanzibar traders as a permanent settlement on the Lualaba. It takes the form of two villages, each set on an eminence above the river, divided by a small valley watered by a little marshy stream and affording admirable rice- grounds. The right bank of the river, on which Nyangwe is situ ated, being well raised, is free from malaria and fever ; whilst the left bank is low and overfloAA-ed by the annual floods, which leave festering, stagnant backwaters. It is about as pestilential a place as it is possible to imagine, notwithstanding which the Wagenya live and flourish there, apparently feeling no ill effects from the miasma. Of the two settlements, the western one is occupied en tirely by Wamerima from Bagamoyo and its neighbouring district. The headman among them is Muinyi Dugumbi, who, finding himself a far greater personage here than he could ever hope to be in his native place, gave up all idea of returning to the coast, and devoted his attention and ener gies to establishing a harem.

Twenty yards behind I march with umbrella and puggery in mitigation of the fierce sun, whde the rear is brought up by my head boatman, bearing provisions and abundance of soda water. We strike straight into the country towards those mountains where is situated the object of my pilgrimage, the China-famed monastery of Yuen Fuh, through a native village, where the everlasting yelping pariah curs pursue me as persistently as a pack of draghounds after a red herring dipped in aniseed, and where I cause the same amazement among the inhabitants as a Life Guardsman among the yokels of Devonshire. Come, the miasma of this Chinese slushy-cum-slime is actually thrown into the shade by the fragrance of the orange trees which thickly crowd the ground in careless wild profusion, charming in their covering of snow-white blossom. Then up the most fertile of valleys, up a glen rather, with a burn which, cleverly dammed at intervals, covers wide steppes of rice fields with exactly the required depth of water. The sluices are adjusted to the nicety of an inch, and the water is further regulated by tread-wheels which the inhabitants work with never varying labour. Here, however, are the usual narrow raised footpaths running between swamps, and the same odiously clever buffaloes, irritated by the scent of a European, doing their very best to bowl me over. Elsewhere the road is bordered with heavy crops of x

The road leads us through an infinity of stone arch ways, down a multiplicity of some thousands of steps, and past rocks carved with the strangest and most elaborate devices and curious inscriptions ; then through vidages scattered about the hot steaming marshes. In all eases clumps of trees are planted, apparently with the view of absorbing some of the noxious miasmas. But the Chinese seem to possess a talent for giving an air of squalor to all their towns and vdlages, and here too there is an entire absence of all sanitary arrangements, the usual accumulation of de composing organic matter, and the consequent terrible stenches. Before I quitted Foochow I came across a German, from whom I obtained some photographs of the adja cent localities. He assured me that the suspicion and dislike with which Chinese of all classes regard his art is invincible. On one occasion he offered thirteen dollars to clear away some obstructing bamboos which were only worth three dollars, but the proprietor spitefully refused. Ten dollars is the lowest bribe which will induce even a coolie to allow himself to be included in a group, as he considers that by v 2

If the skies remained clear, a torrid sun cracked the earth in every direction, and from the openings exhaled fever-laden miasmas. In spite of the care taken to bury each day the animal matter of all kinds, an unhealthy odor infected the air around the tents, too thickly placed, and in which the heat, the vermin, and the flies left very little repose to the soldier. These flies are a veritable plague. They mul tiplied to an infinite extent, and their sharp stings tor mented the men and covered the horses, who were powerless to defend themselves. Night alone brought any relief from their persecutions. Such was our condition at Harrison's Landing. The enemy left us alone, without troubling himself to dis turb us in our inoffensive idleness. He was preparing for more important operations. Once only, on the ist of August, between midnight and one o'clock in the morning, he opened an unexpected cannonade on our transports. To this end he had sent a few batteries on the right bank of the James ; but they were promptly reduced to silence, and retired at daylight without doing us any particular damage. Coggin's Point, of which they had made use, was occupied by our troops and fortified, and the enemy did not trouble us from that point any more. On the 5th of August, Hooker made a reconnoissance towards Malvern Hill. He encountered nobody, and returned as he had gone. On the 6th it was our time to march out to Haxall's Landing. After the battle of Fair Oaks, General Peck had been promoted to the command of a division, and had been replaced in the command of the brigade by a captain of artillery, promoted to brigadier-general in the volunteer service.

THOMAS CHRISTY. 85 me of that quiet hermitage where my great ancestor, Bharadwaj, instructed his disciple, Charak, in the subtle properties of officinal plants, long before Æsculapius sat at the feet of Chiron, the Centaur. What Charak and Susruta in the prehistoric times and Dioscorides in a comparatively modern age, did for the exploitation of vegetable medicines, Mr. Christy and his coadjutors are doing at the pre sent day. With the aid of that systematic generali sation to which the vegetable kingdom has now been reduced and the facilities for analysis afforded bv modern chemistry, the products of the whole world are being thoroughly ransacked for the discovery of new medicines capable to cure disease, alleviate pain and prolong human life. The same spirit of restless enquiry which led the Arab physician, Ahram, to in troduce into Europe the use of rhubarb, cassia, senna, camphor and other eastern medicines, and effected in later times the discovery of quinine, morphia and strychnine, has enabled Mr. Thomas Christy to add many powerful medicines to the British pharmaco pœia, some of which are valuable remedies for obstinate diseases which hitherto baffled all human efforts to cure or control. Thus in the seed of a fruit tree, common all over India, Mr. Christy has discovered an active principle which, I am told, exercises a bene ficial influence on diabetes. The seed lies in heaps under the tree, unused and uncared for, waiting for the rainy season to germinate and form a thick under growth, breathing miasma, until the leisurely browse of a herd of goat opens the way for the purifying rays of the sun to reach the damp soil beneath.

Stanley. was described to me as ' the worst coast for malarious fever on the whole East African sea-board,' I have deliberately come to the conclusion that with care and stern self-control the European can live as safely, if not quite as comfortably, in Africa as in England." During three months of the year in the Congo region it is cold, aud all the year round there is an abundance of shade from the phenomenal amount of cloud which hangs over the territory. A delicious breeze from the South Atlantic cools the heated atmosphere, and residents in the district seldom feel any bad effects from the excessive temperature. The nights are decidedly chilly, and sleep is almost impossible without blankets or warm woollen coverings. The heat of the Congo corresponds with the definition of Bruce, the celebrated African traveller, who says that a man is warm when in ordinary dress, he does not sweat whilst perfectly at rest, but upon moderate motion perspires and cools again, a degree of temperature which may be represented as 75°. The mean of the highest observations of Congo heat is only 90° Fahrenheit, whilst the lowest mean is 67°. Careful attention must be paid to the variableness of the temperature of Congo land, and the constant changes in travelling from the dense moist air of the ravines to the sharp cutting blasts which howl through the rocky canons of the mighty stream, or sweep with piercing violence over the hill tops or elevated plains of the upper Equatorial region. That the atmosphere is saturated with miasma there can be no doubt. The rank vegetation, falling into decay by the process of nature, and shedding its leaves and withered branches into the stagnant pools and fetid morasses which cover vast areas of country in

The climate proved as formidable an enemy as the Portuguese, and most of the crew of the new ship succumbed to the deadly miasma. Stffl another vessel was fitted out, its owners un daunted by loss of men and goods, and sanguine as ever of the glorious prize to be achieved. This time one Richard Jobson took command. He arrived in the Gambia in 1620, only to hear of a new calamity and a new and even more paralysing source of danger — Thompson's men had mutinied and murdered him. Portuguese hostility, a deadly climate, and mutiny in the camp were all arrayed against the hoped for ad vance into the country. But those old mariners were made of stern unyielding stuff, which only death itself could break, and undismayed Jobson defied all dangers and started on his quest. With each succeeding mile new difficulties beset the gaUant band. No pUots could be got to show the way. For a time this proved no serious obstacle. Soon, however, the current grew stronger, and threatened to drive them back. They were in hourly perU from hidden rocks, and falls and rapids raised a foaming barrier to further progress. Sand banks there were, too, on which they grounded, and crocodiles had to be braved in getting clear of them, whUe sea-horses snorted angrily and threatened to swamp the boats. Unprovided with the mosquito-nets of modern times, their days of overpowering fatigue under a melting sun were followed by nights of mad dening torture under the stings of myriad mosquitoes and sandflies. But everything was new and wonderful to them. They were like chUdren bursting into a new world full of undreamed of marvels, a veritable land
001591122	001591122_114	"WHERE SHALL I SETTLE?" 113 Turning to the westward from Leesburg, we pass at once to the gentle, rolling country that is the characteristic type of the upper portions of South Florida. It is a piney woods country, with a top soil of sand and a subsoil of red or white clay, marl, or shell-lime, sometimes cropping to the surface, at others two to ten feet below it. Numerous small lakes break the monotony of the tall trees and green wire-grass that stretch for miles upon miles in all directions ; these vary in size from a half acre to sev eral hundred acres ; nor is the extent of each lakelet always the same, but variable, according as the wet or dry season is paramount ; their base is clear, pure sand ; no marsh, no miasma here, no stagnant water, like our ponds of the North, with their muddy, slimy shores ; and well is it that this is so, for scarcely can a piece of land containing twen ty acres, be found in many localities, and most healthy ones too, without one or more of these little lakelets nest ling in its midst, shimmering in the sunshine like a mirror set in a green frame. Besides the various members of the citrus family, guavas, bananas, and pineapples grow here in great luxuriance, although they are occasionally "chilled in their ardor" by a winter frost ; but a wrapping of moss will usually protect the banana if need be ; the guava, even if it drops its leaves, soon starts out again, and a handful of moss dropped over the pineapple will insure its safety. This fruit is an ex tremely profitable one, a yield of four or five hundred dol lars per acre being nothing uncommon, when the soil is rich and cultivation good. Guavas are also very profitable, and will become a staple all over Florida, now that two species of this valuable fruit have been introduced that are frost-proof, as well as supe rior for jelly to the common sorts ; these are the Cattley and Chinese guavas. 8

Indeed, at times, this stench, added to the fœtid vapours from the feculent growths of rank weeds and poisonous mangroves on the mudbanks, will cause a casual visitant violent vomiting, and it is little wonder that a white man making long stay in the place should succumb to the influences of miasma and malaria To the same reason may, perhaps, be traced the deep apathy into which the Portuguese seem to be helplessly and hopelessly plunged. Down here would congregate the knot of Banyan traders who occupied the island, and represented what little legitimate commerce came to or went from the place. They were the owners of the few launches or whale-boats that lay slant- ing on the beach or rode at anchor some little way out in the harbour. For hours these Indians, in their brilliant Oriental cos tumes, would stand or sit and chat or look solemnly out to sea. What they could find to talk about or what enter prise they could be look ing for across the water, it would be hard to say. But there they were, day in, day out, still talking, still gazing sea ward. I have heard that some of them were well-to-do, and, in fact, one young Banyan, I was told, was passing rich, and owned most of the house property on this portion of Chiloane, which, indeed, was the only portion that had anything beyond the Kaffir huts in the swamp land on the island. The little brass cannon at the Government flag-staff was the ordnance which fired the signal of an approaching vessel.

Almost immediately behind the town rise ranges of mountains ; and at the time of our arrival the coral trees which dotted their sides were in full blossom. This tree, like many others in the tropics, casts its leaves and breaks into blossom before the new foliage shows itself, much like the almond tree, with the dif ference that it is of gigantic size, and its vast spreading head extends itself some seventy or eighty feet from the ground. The mountain-side thus appeared to be covered with a green robe patterned with scarlet. On landing, I went to a hotel kept by an Englishman of the name of Bowles. Some of his acquaintance nick named him " Flowing Bowles," as a tribute to his thirsty disposition. The arrangements of the hotel itself were most original. In lieu of bedrooms, the architect had provided a dormitory divided into cells by partitions of single canvas screens, which only rose half-way to the ceiling. The negro waiter is civil enough, but one cannot depend upon a word he says ; he promises to do everything, but never performs any thing. Negroes are extremely inquisitive, and Bowies' factotum was no exception. The canvas partitions were a source of happiness to him, as he was able to ascertain at all hours what the occupants of the different cells were about. The hillsides in the vicinity of Port of Spain are scored with deep ravines and valleys, and I made many a pleasant excursion on foot and on horse-back along these. One is constantly discovering beautiful views, which occur as a succession of little surprises ;

The screws and bolts for screwing together the steamer were not well greased before starting, to preserve them from rust ; and no second set was sent in case of accident. They were consequently all rusty when wanted for use, and days of hard labour and most fatally dangerous exposure to the fever-breeding miasmas of the Lower Zambesi had to be endured by the whole expedition, while these rusty bolts were being polished ! Hence, on the principle that if a thing is worth doing at all it is worth doing well, we spared no pains in endeavouring to secure that this expedition of 1880 should be properly fitted out. And so important did our friend Mr. McCall especially feel this to be, that not only did he make it a matter of daily and earnest prayer with his colleagues, but he worked so hard in seeing to every detail himself, that for many weeks he scarcely allowed himself time for needful sleep. The departure of this party was owing to the oc currence of a favourable opportunity for the voyage, earlier than had been intended. Communication with the Congo was then not easy. The rates by thc mail steamers from Liverpool were high ; and as they call at a large number of ports on the sickly- West African coast, passengers to the Congo ex perience much delay, and are needlessly exposed to fevers. The West African Steamship Company run cargo boats to the Congo, but these have not, as a rule, any accommodation for passengers. But it happened that that year they were sending out from England

This place is surrounded by Lion Hill and its neigh bouring hills, between the gaps of which the sea breezes sweep suddenly, chilling the bodies who are enveloped in the close heat engendered by its bowl like position." Stanley is not alone in giving such prominence to the dangerous effects of sudden alternations of tem perature produced by currents of cool air. Some years ago we sent out to our missionaries on the Congo an elaborate treatise on tropical fevers written by an Indian military medical man, who had large and varied experience with the British troops in all parts of India. His conclusion was that the one great cause of fever and of mortality was not malaria, but simply chill. When we requested the late beloved Henry Craven, who was then at home on furlough, to examine the work, saying at the same time what its theory was, he took it with a smile of pity and incredulity, and said, " Poor man ! if he doesn't believe in malaria, he knows nothing about African fever, at any rate." A few days later he returned the volume to us, saying earnestly : " It is very strange, but positively I believe the author is right ! I have reviewed all our experience in the light of his remarks, and every incident of it seems to fall in with his theory." Miasma and malaria, or bad air, no doubt play their part in producing illness, in Africa as well

But about the middle of the mouth news of a contrary character came. The papers told us that " Beast Butler" had been appointed commissioner of exchange, with plen ary powers, and that, in consequence of this appointment, the plan was virtually abandoned, for the Confederate au thorities would never consent to treat with the " Brute." Bombastic threats of horrible treatment of the Federal prisoners were made unless he were removed ; they were to be shipped to the scorching climate of Southern Geor gia, where, amid the marshes and swamps of that low country, the heat and miasma would accomplish the fatal work faster than the bullet at the front; that the United States government would find itself mistaken, if it thought it could force them to exchange a negro for a white man ; and that how much soever they loved their friends, who were pining in the military dungeons of the North, they would let them rot there before they would submit to the dictations of the " Beast." The article closed by stating that it was now a question of time as to which government would soonest yield, with much more to the same effect. The news filled us with the deepest gloom, for we came to the conclusion that if our government had fixed upon a course of policy, it would " fight it out on that line," even if we were all sacrificed. The date of our release was now entirely beyond con jecture, and we made up our minds that the only way left to escape death was to escape from prison. All our thoughts were turned in this direction, and every method which ingenuity could suggest was immediatety can vassed, and its merits duly weighed. On the evening of the 15th of January, a young man, named Williamson, had made good his escape from No. 6, by climbing down the high board fence that inclosed the prison yard, the cross pieces of which formed a kind of ladder on the out side. As he reached the ground, he was challenged by the guard, but, by a few vigorous leaps, he was soon out of sight in the darkness. The guard exploded a cap at

The train kept straight on, turning neither right nor left, bearing almost due south. Slowly and gloomily we allowed the convic tion to settle upon our minds that we were now bound for the long-threatened swamps of Georgia, there, amid the heat and miasma, to die. A few tried to console them selves with the thought that Congress, knowing our suffer ings so well, would make every effort for our exchange, and that Savannah was the point toward which we were moving, for that purpose. Many murmured at the seem ing indifference to our fate, thus exhibited by our govern ment ; but, with our limited knowledge of the reasons for such a course, we could come to no conclusion, other than that a sacrifice was demanded for some purpose, and we were the designated victims. During the afternoon we reached Gaston, where we ex changed both guard and cars, and proceeded toward Raleigh. Arriving within four miles of that place shortly after dark, we halted and camped in the woods for the night. A train was backed down to us from Raleigh early next morning, and we commenced our journey for the far-famed Andersonville prison-pen. Little of interest transpired on our trip to the South, except the insignificant accident of three of the cars be ing thrown from the track and completely wrecked, do ing damage to no one, however. Our route lay through Raleigh, Charlotte, Columbia, Augusta, and Macon. These towns bore the same dilapidated appearance, ex hibited the same quiet, grass-grown streets, the same lazy, listless air, which characterizes so many cities of the South. At Augusta, a prisoner, having by some means procured a rebel uniform, put it on, "and while walking around among us was ordered away. Complying with the order, he stepped aside, and, falling in with a regi ment that was going to Atlanta, he joined it, and com menced his " trip " to the North. He was, however, be trayed by a man who informed him that a ferry, which he wished to cross, was unguarded ; on reaching which,

Suddenly he fell into a deep hole, and the man and box went almost out of sight, while I was in an agony at the fate which, threatened the despatches. Fortunately, he recovered himself and stood up, while I shouted to him, with a loaded revolver pointed at his head, ' Look out ! Drop that box, and I'll shoot you.' All the men halted in their work while they gazed at their comrade who was thus imperilled by bullet and flood. The man himself seemed to regard the pistol with the greatest awe, and after a few desperate efforts succeeded in getting the box safely ashore." From this stream they came, in about an hour, to the main river. Its wild waters were such as to fill them with the greatest fear. They succeeded, however, in crossing it ; the strongest man swimming over with a rope tied round his waist, and the others being dragged through with ropes. This was their method of travel from day to day until the 30th. On that day they passed hurriedly through the jungle of Msuwa. "What dreadful odours," exclaims Stanley, " and indescribable loathing this jungle pro duces ! It is so dense that a tiger could not crawl through it ; it is so impenetrable that an elephant could not force his way !

Malaria is in the air we breathe ; the road is infested with ' hot-water ' ants, which bite our legs until we dance and squirm about like madmen. Yet, somehow, we are fortunate enough to escape annihilation, and many another traveller might also. Yet here, in verity, are the ten

The South-East wind is the fine weather courier, though that known as the Marin sometimes brings clouds, and a fall of the thermometer. The South-West and West winds are heavy and humid, and least bearable by invalids ; whilst our rainy winds come from the North and North-East. As to " Master Mistral," called in Provencal maestraou or mistraou, he blows with much less force than at Cannes and Nice, and his visitation is comparatively rare. When he does come, the unpleasantness caused is not without compensating advantages, for he carries away with him many of the bad humours of the atmosphere, and fine weather generady fodows closely in his track. The authoress of "Vera" draws a forcible picture of the passage of this much-abused "scourge of Provence." The cypresses bend to the earth, the windows shake, the shutters crack, the wdd wind whistles through the door; the dust flies everywhere — into your eyes, your hair, your clothes ; your hat flies away, your hair turns grey. But your spirits are buoyant ad the same ; the sky is of the palest blue, the air transparent, and every detad of the landscape stands out clear, as at no other time. The knowing peasants call this " lou bon rent," and ready this prince of the power of the air is a pubhc benefactor, ridding the country of damp and miasma, and acting as a great sanitary agent for the whole of the coast. No better proof could be given of the excellence of the climate of Grasse than the longevity of the native population. Figures codected by M. Paul Senequier from the official registers shew that between 1880 and 1890, out of 3,139 deaths,

Two hours' marching, by a very winding road, skirting the spurs of the high ranges, brought us to the top of a ridge from which there is a rapid descent to the valley ; the distance was only a few miles, but it took us two hours to accomplish.

When we asked what this official was going to do, we were told that he was about to investigate the action of some unruly tribes. These tribes, it is needless to say, were the French. Information regarding Tonquin must be of interest. When we were at Men-tzii, which lies one and a-half or two days' journey north of Manhao, we found the plateau level to be 3882 feet by boiling-point. A range of hills, seemingly some 2500 to 3000 higher, intervened between the Songca and Manhao. Taking the height at that place to be 250 feet above sea-level — a fair allowance to allow for the probable rise from the mouth — an ascent of at least 6132 feet would have to be made, and a descent of 2500 before the Men-tzu plain can be reached. The inhabitants of Yunnan have a great dread of Manhao and the valley of the Songca as being deadly, owing to the miasma. According to the accounts we had the Yiinnanese always return to the top of the plateau the same day on which they descend, which they seldom do. It was my desire to visit the Songca and follow its course up from Manhao to Yuan-kiang. At Men-tzii I made every effort to secure guides for the purpose ; but, although we offered a large sum, we could induce no one to go. The reason given was the unhealthiness and absence of any roads.

An unauthorized religious body neces sarily escapes all precise definitions. It is not recog nized, that is evident, and does not ask to be ; it has no collective character and does not show itself under any civil form. The religious persons who compose it come under the common law. They have its burdens and its responsibilities ; they have also its advantages and prerogatives. In what way are these bodies illegal because they are not authorized? How is their authori zation necessary, since those who belong to them remain under the common law?"1 Objections were raised to the anti-human character of the contemplative orders, to the unpatriotic education given by some of the teaching orders, and, finally, to the social danger re sulting from the accumulation of wealth in convents. Many Christians consider that the contemplative life has been wrongly introduced into Christianity, Avhich is a religion of action, but it does not follow that the State has any right whatever to meddle, and to force the doors of modern Port-Royals. More important still is the question of education ; but there, again, on what principle can intervention be grounded, and in what manner is it to be exercised? If one deplores that a whole class of young Frenchmen are reared in ideas which do not appear to be those that would render them most competent to serve their country, these ideas are not, nevertheless, such that they can be dealt with as one deals with miasmas, by isolation and antiseptic treatment; it is primarily a question of a "state of 1 Ch. de Mazade, Revue des Deux Mondes.

The fish thus landed averaged about 8 inches long, the breast and belly were broad and the head flat, with a wide mouth like a dog-fish. The flesh was palatable. It was on leaving the shingle camp that the real struggle began against obstacles more formidable than we had yet en countered. The path got worse and worse, and the men had to precede the mules, pick in hand, and break a track across the shoot of rubble and loose stones. By this means we won a pre carious foothold, though in some places the projecting crags thrust us out over dangerous declivities. Stepping cautiously in Indian file, we escaped any worse accident than the fall of one mule, which luckily recovered itself unhurt. The valley flora was unlike that of the 5,000-feet plateaux we had traversed. Here the trees had dense foliage, their lower boughs often covered with fruit ; acacias grew close, and fig-trees smothered in gigantic creepers and a broad-leaved moss. On every side were orchids, and ferns with spiral fronds twining round the central stem. The prolific forest teemed with plants of rare grace and tropical profusion. But its sunless depths and rank undergrowth exhaled miasma and a fever-laden moisture ; so that, although the temperature was not high, we perspired in the damp heat at each heavy step, and breathed a tepid vapour that made us believe the reputation for insalubrity given by the Chinese to the valley of the Salwen. Our camp of the 29th (June) was still by the torrent. Our men had exhausted their provisions — a lesson to them to be more provident, and to attend to our orders that they should always carry three or four days' supplies. Fortunately, we had a ham and some rice to share with them. In the morning, as I went to bathe in the river, I discovered a liana bridge swung from

I shall have occasion to return to it at greater length, and will only say in this place that it embraces nearly every variety of plant, flower, and fern known in the tropical and sub-tropical zones. European fruits, flowers, and vegetables can be easily and largely cultivated on the highest plateaux of the Sierra Maestra. The climate of Cuba is, for the tropics, a very toler able one, quite enjoyable indeed from November to the beginning of May, during which time the heat is rarely oppressive. The summer season is extremely enervating, and in many parts of the island actually dangerous, on account of the excessive heat and the incessant torrents of rain, which together create an unhealthy steaming miasma. The forests, with their prodigious stratas of decaying vegetation, emit, especi ally in summer, unwholesome malarial vapours, and the lagoons and marshes on the broads are sometimes hidden for days at a time by a dense and deadly but perfectly white fog. Yellow fever is said not to have made its appearance till 1761 ; at any rate it is from that date only that it has been regarded as a distinct disease indigenous to the island. The deadly vomito nigro has often appeared in various parts of Cuba in epidemic as well as isolated form. It rarely if ever attacks the negroes, but has proved only too fatal to newcomers.1 I cannot help thinking that it is mainly 1 The rainfall of Havana is said to be 92*68 ins., more than double that of the opposite part of Florida.

It is a place where, if one were ship wrecked, the river itself would be less dangerous than the jungle with its fevers and its beasts of prey ; and so, here and there on the shore there are white towers where sailors who have been cast away can find food and medicine and be out of reach of tigers, while they wait for some passing boat to take them off. We advance slowly, with infinite precautions. The great river is vehement, and would quickly overturn the boat if, caught for an instant on a sand-bank, she presented her side to the current. We take soundings constantly. The river bed is of moving sands, which the violence of the water displaces, agitates, digs out, heaps up. Now the shores close in, and cultivated lands appear : vast golden harvests, light-coloured rice-fields, noble clusters of shining palms. On the edge of the bank a white file of natives is moving through the tall grass. Upon the river great vessels are passing slowly, powerful steamers, whose destinations are England, and America, and Australia. There are brigs at anchor in great numbers, the splendid sunlight shining upon their poor worn sides, which have the sinuous curve of the waves. They have laboured on their solitary way, lost in the far-off darkness of ocean, racked in all their ribs, lifted on cruel waves, falling into treacherous hollows with heavy shock, — patient hours of obscure suffering. To-day, how peaceful is their sleep upon the shin ing, rippling surface of the great river !

" He showed me Mokwae's son, quite a young man, whom he destines for the office of Morantsiane at Sesheke. " Very well," he said, " your colleague must remain at Sesheke to instruct and direct this young man. There must be another moruti at Seoma, another at Nalolo, another at Libonta. When will some more come to help you ? " I underline the question and pass it on to you, dear friends, and to the Churches of Basuto-land. He showed himself very kindly disposed as regards the choice of a site, so much so that he wished to come with me to visit the different places which he believed best adapted to our establishment ; but he was hindered from so doing, and the Gambella accompanied me instead. Besides Sefula, which may one day be occupied by the Nalolo missionary, I was favourably impressed by Kanyonyo, a place which last year we found encumbered by corn and manioc. It is a little valley close to Mongu, not far from the capital. The annual floods never come there ; and the south-west wind, which blows during the worst six months of the year, drives away the marshy miasmas, although it is this same wind which, sweeping afterwards over the swampy valleys, becomes impregnated with malaria. Sefula enjoys the same conditions. And these are, I think, the least unhealthy parts of the Valley that I know, relying on our experience of Sesheke on the north and Leshoma on the south of the river. Sesheke is as healthy as Leshoma is the reverse. This year, while we all enjoyed excellent health here, all the members of Dr. Holub's expedition were ill at Leshoma, and one died there. Lewanika, hearing of our losses in bullocks, sent an order to the chiefs of Sesheke to give me seventeen. Will the order be carried out punctually? That remains to be seen. At Mr. Westbeech's suggestion, he has sent gangs of men, so as to save us the expense, to clear a road for the waggons through the forests which we must traverse. He himself wished us to start immediately, but we shall be obliged to wait till the waters dry up, so it will be July before we are able to leave. The return journey only took us eight days.

Close confinement and miasma broke Mackenzie's health in a short time ; he could no longer eat the food which his children carried him — it was feared he might be poisoned by the gaol fare — his wife was in delicate health, his mother had reached ninety years, and his mirrd was torn with anxiety over the illness of a beloved daughter. The other prisoners were allowed occasional days of freedom to visit taverns and roam the town, but no such liberty came to him. "My dear little girl grew worse and worse, she was wasted to a skeleton. I had followed four of her sisters and a brother to the churchyard, but I might not look upon her. One fine day she was carried ... to the prison, and her mother and I watched her for forty-eight hours, but the gaoler vexed us so that she had to be taken home again, where she was soon in the utmost danger, and when her poor little sister comes to tell me how she is at dusk . . the gaoler will tell her to wait in the public place in the gaol, perhaps for an hour or more, till supper comes, as he can't be put to the trouble of opening my cage twice." Then the poor old mother sickens, and he knows her time has come. He makes every effort to be allowed to see her, and when he has given up hope writes her a truly beautiful letter of farewell. In it he thanks her for all she had done for him, all she has been to him, and that if the wealth of the world were his he would give it to be at her side. "But wealth I have none, and of justice there is but little here." He tells her of his hopes to put, with his coming liberty, the rest in comfort, but " sorrow fills my heart when I am told that you will not have your

Most of it is shoal water, but there is a channel to the open sea half a mile in breadth, and seventeen miles in length, which is well marked out by buoys, and easily followed, for sailing vessels constantly come in. There are no pilots as yet, but the Portuguese Govern ment is having a naval survey made, and a proper pilot department is being organised. When ships have once reached the port they are in absolute safety, protected as they are by the horse-shoe banks of the estuary. The disadvantage of Beira as a port is that during neap-tides lighters cannot be brought under the crane because they cannot approach sufficiently close to the wharf, and the town lies so low, that in equinoctial spring-tides the main streets are not infrequently under water ; but a French company has been granted a con cession to fill up and drain the creek which runs behind it, and to make a proper channel from which boats can be discharged. I should mention that the Pungwe is a tidal river navigable as far as Fontesvilla, about forty miles from Beira, and that the Busi is also navigable for a short distance. As a town Beira has several advantages. It is almost separated from the mainland by a narrow creek, and is, for East Africa, exceptionally healthy. There is nearly always a cool breeze from the sea, which blows back the miasma from the swamps that lie behind. Being on

Probably this generation, who have benefited by the Commissioners' planting, will not endorse Mr. London's opinion, but then letters to The Times are not always temperate, vide the following — in that paper of Feb. 13, 1844 : — " Sir, permit me, through your columns, to call the attention of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests to a serious nuisance in Hyde Park, which, if continued and increased, will be a permanent injury to the Park and its neighbourhood. A large excavation has been made in the south-western side of the Park, for the purpose of procuring gravel ; and this excavation, extending over more than an acre of ground, and 15 or 20 feet deep, is being filled up with the refuse from a nightman's or dust man's yard. The stench which proceeds from the spot, whilst the work is in progress, is of a most pestiferous description ; but this is not the worst of the mischief. The real damage is in altering the character of the superficial strata ; so that, here after, the moisture which heretofore drained off through the gravel, will be retained near the surface, and generate miasma." , Then came the grievance of so called " encroach ment " — and a gentleman asks in The Times of March 21, 1845 : " Why have several hundred yards of Hyde Park been enclosed during the last weeks — not by a low wooden rail, but a high iron fence ? This encroachment is making in the space between Albert Gate and the Piccadilly Gate ; and, by it,

Could any Central American state control it? The first revolution would put it in the hands of some strong European power, and any European power in this hemisphere would be inimical to the inter ests of this government. No private party or cor poration could hold it. No weak power can hold it. It must be in a masterful grasp. In case of war, and war must be considered, the strategical relations of this canal to this hemisphere will be very much more important than the relation of the Suez to the Eastern hemisphere. Consider its strategical situa tion and the great military possibilities it develops. Careful surveys of every portion of Central America have shown that the only feasible route between the oceans is the Nicaraguan route, and that route is through the great fresh water lake of Nicaragua. This lake has sufficient capacity to hold the navies of the world, and it is the only portion of Central America where health reigns. It is in the gap of the mountains through which the cool trade winds blow and prevent fever and miasma. Here is the only place in Central America where the stricken or wounded sailor can enjoy the coolness of a mountain sanitarium, with fresh water and tropical fruits in abundance. At Panama men died like flies and were as little considered. At Nicaragua, out of 1,600 men employed by the Nicaraguan company

The work of men of this stamp being carried out with a faint ing or unwilling spirit, was certain to be grossly defective, and was, therefore, well calculated to provoke harshness in the attitude of their master towards them. Regarding them as incurably worthless, there was little inducement on his part to encourage them. He accepted them as incorrigible, and weary of chafing against an evil which it was impos sible to remove, he finally sank into a state of carelessness and indifference as to the matter of their improvement.2 As the servants increased in number, it became more necessary to employ overseers to supervise them, and this was especially the case in the instance of planters who had obtained patents to large tracts so widely separated in the point of locality that the owners were unable to give the management of them their constant attention.3 When a more careful superintendence was required than the land- 1 Life of Thomas Hellier, pp. 28, 29.

The easiest method by which to reach the Piræus, undoubtedly, is via Brindisi by rail, to which port the yachtsman will have sent his vessel. He can then call at Corfu and Patras, en route to the Piræus, and will, necessarily, pass through the Corinthian Canal, of which, also, I have given photo graphs and written a short description. After Athens has been visited, he will have an immense number of harbours to choose from, on his road to Constantinople. Murray gives short accounts of no less than about fifty of these. It should, however, be remembered that whether the coast of Asia Minor be followed up, or the coast of Roumelia, on neither coast can provisions, excepting those required for daily use, such as vegetables, eggs, and, occasionally, bread, be obtained. The yachtsman should be careful to lay in, at Athens, a sufficient amount of coal to take him to Constantinople, or at any rate to Gallipoli, as well as provisions of all descriptions, that may be required for the voyage. The harbour of Smyrna he will certainly visit. In the gulf of Smyrna there are numerous sheltered and convenient anchorages, but I do not anticipate that the visitor will remain there any great length of time. The town is badly drained, and the miasma which proceeds from the Meles valley is decidedly unpleasant, though it is reported not to be unhealthy. It is impossible to give a description of the many interesting islands, which the yachtsman passes almost every hour, on his road from Smyrna to Constantinople, but I shall hope, on some future occasion, to give photographs of many of these,

We flew past bazaars and houses, gardens and mosques, scattering groups of men right and left. The sharp yelping yell of the chappar urges the horses to a furious gallop. We head due south. The horses, broad-chested, clean-limbed creatures, were fresh, and well adapted for their gallop of over 20 miles. The swamp jungle and forest is on either side of us, but the road is the king's highway, and semi macadamized. It runs in a straight line in front and behind us. The vista is arched over by boughs which meet like the arches of a tunnel. A poisonous haze is our element ; we are encompassed by clouds of miasma. Such life as we see is of the rankest. A shudder darts through me when I catch a view of the intricacies of water settled in the gloom.

When we were about to start we made the acquaintance of a pleasant party of Englishmen, who were travelling for the purpose of groAving beards, and for other similarly cogent reasons. We all agreed to start on the folloAving morning, and cross the " field of forays " together, to Burak ; but their master the dragoman determined other wise, fearing the length and danger of the way.

Clouds of rice-dust float all over the mill, and settle everywhere, making queer spectacles of the dark-skinned Madrasis. The dust is carefully swept up and sold to Chinamen, who fatten their pigs upon it. The milled grain descends to the ground-floor again, and pours in a stream through shoots into bags stand ing ready on weighing machines. There is a crowd of Burmese girls ready to sew them up as they are filled, and another band of coolies to carry them off in the cargo boats ready to convey them to the ships away up in the Rangoon harbour. Paddy that came in a Burmese boat in the morn ing may by night be safe stowed in the shape of milled rice deep down in the hold of a ship bound " to the Channel for orders." Everything is used but the paddy husk. That is passed out from the fanners, and pours in a great stream from wooden shoots into the creek. There it floats back wards and forwards with the tide, and creates miasma and narrows the river ; still no other feasible means of getting rid of it has yet been devised. Several engineers and others in Rangoon have tried special furnaces for consuming the husk, but with no very great measure of success. Mr. Cowie's system is probably the best ; but it requires a special kind of boiler and furnace, and has not as yet been generally adopted. The economy in fuel as well as the advantage to the river would be immense if the scheme were perfected. And so we have seen the paddy sown out and mown, and passing from the hands of the cultivators, through the mills, into the great ships that carry the rice away to all parts of the world.

Dur ing the summer succeeding his appointment as lieutenant-general, Grant did not come often to Washington, although his headquarters were for most of the time within a day's journey of the capi tal. Later in that year, armed with a letter of in troduction from the President, I met him at City Point, while I was on a visit to the Army of the Potomac. At that time his headquarters were at City Point. On one side of his wall-tent stood the great com mander's narrow bedstead ; and a rude pine-table covered with maps and papers, two or three camp chairs, a military chest, and a box or two, made up the furniture of the headquarters of Grant. The cares of the day were over when we paid our visit, and the general began an easy, offhand talk about politics and the then late elections, which he con sidered as being of immense importance because, as he said, the political legislation of Congress was now so closely allied to the prosecution of the war that every officer watched its course with the deep est anxiety. He spoke pleasantly of McClellan, was sorry for his personal mortification and defeat for the presidency, and said that he hoped that McClel lan would see his way clear to accept the handsome salary that it was then reported had been offered him by the Illinois Central Railroad Company.

These and other advantages give it the unenviable reputation of being one of the worst places in all civilization, in climate and accommodations for travelers. Not long ago the place was a huge marsh, and even now the ground is only about one foot above sea-level, and liable to disaster from floods by land and storms by sea. When the snow-floods come pouring down the rapid Rion the waters overflow the streets, and for a time the inhabitants become amphibious. The ladies then don their high boots with long leggings, and their promenades undergo no interruption. Most of the houses are one story, set up on posts, allowing free course to the water, and affording good berths to the millions of frogs, which, being in such close proximity to the bedroom window, offer abundant music without putting their bowstrings under too great tension. The miasma which necessarily arises from low lands under such circumstances, and from the immense swamps in the neighborhood, renders the sanitary condition bad in the extreme. Murray advises one by no means to pass the night there, and it is confidently affirmed that no European has ever lodged there and escaped the fever. English sailors are prohibited by government regulation from landing at the place. Either liberal doses of quinine saved us, or the slight chill and fever which one of our party had three weeks after ward proved the universality of the rule.

According to the reports of the Palestine Exploration Fund, " the survey results were rather of negative than of positive value. A very close and careful examination of the ground showed that no traces of the sites of any towns occur between Jericho and the Dead Sea shore, the remaining ruins belonging to mediæval monastic establishments ; and that no springs suitable for the supply of even small villages exist, or probably ever existed, in this district." The inference seems, therefore, meantime to be — so complete and overwhelming was the terrible catastrophe in which the ill-fated Cities perished — that not so much as even their probable sites can be identified. Still, it is not impossible but that some day or other — so great have been the wonders already brought to light by recent explorations — even the sites of the Cities may be recovered, and new corroboration of Scripture be thus furnished. DEAD SEA FABLES. Fabulous stories have been current in all ages as to the Dead Sea. " Seneca relates that bricks would not sink in it. Early travellers describe the lake as an infernal region ; its black and fetid waters always emitting a noisome smoke or vapour, which, being driven over the land, destroys all vegetation like a frost. Hence, too, the popular report that birds cannot fly over its deadly waters." " It is true that the tropical heat causes immense evaporation, the exhalations from the sulphurous springs and marshes taint the air for miles, and the miasma of the swamps on the north and south gives rise to fevers and renders the ordinary inhabitants feeble and sickly. But this has no necessary connection with the Dead Sea or the character of its waters. Wherever a copious fountain bubbles up along the shores, or a mountain streamlet affords water for irrigation, tangled thickets of tropical trees, shrubs, and flowers spread out their foliage.

But suddenly, as in a dream when one awaketh, I turn from these fancies of a distant past to the realities before me. A disforested and disenchanted valley ; a fouled and pestiferous stream, churned into filthy foam, and discoloured with the refuse of a hundred mills ; banks, bedraggled with the wrecks of rotting trunks ; and thorn and briar-bush clotted with waste of cotton and webbed with threads of weft. Smooth stones, once the glory of the river's boulder bed, all stained with flow of blackened waters ; and bobbins, corks, fragments of broken skips, and the decaying carcases of domestic animals, chasing one another, as in a dance of death, amongst the swirls and eddies. Thus before me runs the once beautiful river, now an open sink of feculent deposit, a miasma of death, a blackened and despoiling stream. Though this is no highly-coloured picture of the Irwell as it flows through Rossendale, there are beauty spots upon its banks that well repay a visit. One such we find at Stubbin's Vale, where we will join the river and ramble upwards towards its source. This vale is one rich growth of trees, and shows how earth responds to man's endeavour when he obeys the Almighty's mandate "to dress and to keep it." The spreading beech, the fragrant lime, the variegated syca more and the fairy birch here group and intermingle, and dapple the pathway with a mosaic of shadow. Unwillingly leaving this umbrageous path, and passing beneath the rail way arches, we follow the river to Chatterton Fold. Here stand the ruins of the mill around which waxed the famous fight in 1826, when Rossendale pitched her sons against the power of steam.

The largest river in Palestine, has been sufficiently treated in the ' Memoirs ' of the Palestine Exploration Fund and in other places, and is only of importance to us so far as it refers to the portion in the district between the Lake of Huleh and the Sea of Tiberias= Its slow course down to the Lake of Huleh is sur rounded by marshes and papyrus brakes; when it emerges from this lake it has an uniform flow inas much as in a stretch of 10 miles it falls 689 feet.

The broad Huleh marshes narrow beneath the lake to a small valley, through which the stream glides down to the Batihah and into the Lake of Tiberias.

Another snake, the Dendrophispicta, was a great nuisance to me, for it would come by night and kill my chickens ; but it is a beau tiful creature, of a warm brown colour, brilliantly orna mented with spots and stripes of a bright bluish-green sheen. I saw one or two specimens of the sea-snake (Hydro phis) on the coral reef, but never succeeded in securing one. They are dangerous creatures to meddle with, for their bite is said to be very poisonous, and, equipped as I was on my reef expeditions only with weapons for collecting corals, echinoderms, and the like, I thought it better on the whole to let them go their own way. It must not be supposed, however, that because there are no terres trial poisonous snakes in Talisse that they are also wanting in Celebes. It is true there are very few really dangerous snakes in that island, and very few cases are on record of natives having been mortally or even dangerously bitten ; but, nevertheless, I was told that in elevated plains and forests there is a timid black snake which is greatly feared by the natives, whose bite is said to be extremely poisonous. There were not many places in Talisse favourable for amphibia, but in a muddy stinking pool some distance from my hut a hoarse croaking, followed by a hasty splash, proclaimed the existence of some kind of frog. From the glimpses I caught of this animal, I believe it was the Rana macrodon (Kuhl), but I should not like to pin my faith to this. If I had possessed at the time a proper keenness for herpetology, I should have raked that pond with a net until I caught one ; but, to tell the truth, the stench was so offensive when undisturbed, and spoke so loudly of the dread miasmas of the tropics, that I thought it wiser to direct my energies to other pursuits until more favourable opportunities presented themselves.

By the time we had finished our inspection of Beo the sun was sinking on to the horizon, and as we rowed back to the ' Ternate ' the whole sea and sky was illumined by one of those brilliant rosy-red sunsets so frequently seen in tropical lands. The long coast-line of Karkelang and its undulating plains and hill ranges were lighted up by the brilliant colours of the sunset. The whole scene was as gorgeous and beautiful as could be well imagined, ancl everything seemed to speak of peace, of quietness ancl beauty. It was hard to believe we' were leaving a district haunted with deadly miasmas, and that the elements were shedding a pall of colour and beauty, as it were, over a scene of human suffering and death but rarely paralleled even in these fever- stricken climes. We left Beo at about half-past six in the evening of Saturday, November 21, and steamed half-speed all night towards Great Sangir. At daylight the next morning we were close to the northern shore of that island, and in sight of the great Awu volcano, whose slopes are broken up by magnificent ravines and gorges. This volcano has been, perhaps, more destructive than any in the Moluccas. We have records of a most terrible eruption which lasted from December 10 to December 16 in the year 1711. Sjamsialam and his son, the Princess Lorolabo and her daughter Sara banong, and over two thousand people of the kingdom of Kandahar were killed (42). On March 2, 1856, there was another fearful eruption, which lasted until March 17, and nearly three thousand human lives were lost (14). The streams of boiling water

It was a very disagreeable job, and by no means easy to release the bones from the rotten and putrescent flesh, and although I sifted with the greatest care the sand I dug up from the grave, I found that many of the smaller bones of the tail and wrist were missing, owing perhaps to the depredations of crabs and worms. Three days of packing and my task was done. I saw all my cases safely on board a Sangirese sopi bound for Manado, and on the evening of June 1 0 I said farewell for the last time both to the ' Flying Fish ' and Talisse island. It was with feelings of considerable remorse that I left Talisse, the work I had commenced being in an unfinished and imperfect condition. The little island, typical in every respect of the fertile, hilly, coral-girt islands of this volcanic region of the tropical world, had afforded me many pleasant rambles, abundance of material for observation and research, and many interesting studies of Malay character and habit. It would be unfair indeed if, from what I have said above, my little island home should gain a character for unhealthi ness that it does not deserve. It would be ridiculous to assert that an island in the tropics with extensive mangrove swamps and coral reefs can be considered at any time or in any region very salubrious ; but the miasmas of such places, under ordinary circumstances and with a little experience, may be successfully encountered by the European for many years, as has been conclusively proved by the lives of the missionaries who labour there. The close of the year 1885 was, however, an exception ally unhealthy time, owing, it was said, to the long delay of the rains, and many persons sickened and died in Celebes then who had up to that time enjoyed good health. It is not only possible, but I believe even probable, that if in the future another English naturalist should take up his resi-

We were to encamp near the foot of the mountain range, but the air in the bottom of the valley being surcharged with the fragrance of flowers, very hot, damp, and malarial, I determined to pitch our camp higher up, where the air was more pure, a thing utterly incomprehensible to the blacks. I followed my old rule and made my camp on high ground, to escape the miasma which produces fever and is found only in the bottoms. We had hard work to make our way up the slope in order to find a suitable place for encampment. It was dark before I released the horses, which disappeared in the tall grass. As usual we awoke a little before sunrise ; but it took the natives some time to rub the sleep out of their eyes. When a black is roused he does not at once recover his senses, and he needs more time than the uneducated whites to pull himself together. It was always difficult for my men to find their bearings in the morning, and they always had much to do before they were ready to begin the day. They lazily stretch and rub their limbs, and then sit down by the fire and light their pipes. When they at length are entirely awake they go to work and make a sort of toilet. They clean out their noses in a manner more peculiar than graceful. This morning I took particular notice of Morbora, who took a little round stick and put it up his nose horizontally, at the same time twirling it between his fingers, whereupon the contents disappeared in the same manner as among the apes in zoological gardens. The natives hardly ever wash themselves. In the heat of the summer, it is true, they throw themselves into every pool of water they come to, just like a dog ; but this is done only in order to cool themselves, and not for the sake of clean liness. In the winter, when it is cold, they never bathe. If they have soiled their hands with honey or blood they usually wipe them on the grass, or even sometimes wash them in their own water. In the morning, or when they sit round the fire, they are usually occupied in pulling their beards and the hair from their bodies. It is also a common thing to see even the women take a fire-brand and scorch the hairs off. The hair

It may be that modern Italians have as much dread of an overcharge of oxygen as they have of soap and water, and are averse to making any sudden changes ; but might it not be effected by degrees — begin at one part of the town and gradually encroach on the rest? Health officers and sanitary inspectors (if they have any) must be aware that the present condition of their city as much as invites the prevalence of an epidemic. Can they complain, therefore, if cholera or any other pestilence whose germs may be floating in the atmosphere will come and take up its abode among them ? Italy has generally been the start ing point in Europe for infectious diseases, and its geographical position has been pointed to as the cause. Is it not probable that the neglect of sanitary precautions may also be a factor ? Certain places, which are now hot-beds of miasma, were in the old Roman days considered healthy, and made sanatoriums from the crowded capital. The art of drainage was better under stood in those places at that time than now, and the brave old Roman did not object to have his body washed and perfumed, whilst his degenerate descendant has a constitutional antipathy to both. On arrival at the station we found the railway time about 20 minutes behind ours ; we were con sequently at leisure to choose a compartment and obtain our tickets.

But in that black and savage haunt of robbers, the Pope remembered Avignon too well. He came home at Christmas time in 1379 ; but it was only to die in the beautiful familiar palace; and, out of France, the faithful called his death the judgment of the Lord upon him who looks back from the plough. A brighter epoch opened for his successor, Gregory XL The genius of King Charles and his brothers, the Dukes of Anjou and Burgundy, had restored the fortunes of France ; and Anjou, at any rate, was aware of the advantage which the House of France might reap from the partnership of a Pope at Avignon. For the Pope, of course, was a Frenchman and willing to assist in the triumph of his country, a triumph he could best assist by remaining at Avignon to further and inspire the policy of his king. Every tie, indeed, united to detain Gregory in Provence. He was no ascetic, indifferent to glory or to comfort ; but an affectionate, natural man, loving his ease, loving his family, loving the land where he was born. At Avignon he dwelt among his friends, his kinsmen, his father the Comte de Beaufort, his mother, his four sisters. The stories of his Cardinals could only add to his own horror of that distant Italy whose language he could not speak. He was ill, and he dreaded the miasma of Borne ; he needed the comforts of that Court whose luxurious memory should long survive in France. "You should have come to Europe a few years ago, before the

The King received the ambassador graciously, but in the presence of the Florentine envoys ; and the party of pity, and the party of honour (if so we may name the factions of Ligny and of Briconnet) were both assembled when the Pisan advocate began to address the King : " Now for nearly ninety years," * began Burgundio Lolo, " the city of Pisa, once the greatest in Italy, once carrying her Empire into the recesses of the East, has suffered the yoke of an intolerable servitude. The cruel avarice of Florence has brought our city into so great a depth of desolation that her streets are almost empty of inhabitants, for the most of her citizens, unable to endure this grinding slavery, have gone into a voluntary exile abandoning their native land. Those that remain, incapable of plucking from their hearts the love of country, have indeed renounced all else that renders life endurable. The acerb and cruel exactions of foreign taxes, the insolent rapine of private Florentines, the injustice that forbids us by art or trade or public office to recruit our fallen fortunes, have left us an empty life, plundered of all enjoyment : nay, dangerous even and deadly, for the clayey marshes that our ancestors kept with exact and pious diligence, are now so little drained, so long neglected that the waters of Maremma sap our fairest palaces and our churches, our houses, our public buildings fall into ruins while the miasma of those * See the speech — true, we may suppose, in fact if not in hrase — as reported in Guiceiardini's " History."

The evening air, too, is damp and chill and cold, and an unpleasant suggestion of miasma is borne upon the light breeze ; for the island is rich in swamp and narrow dykes and ditches, which at low tide leave their beds of mud and ooze uncovered, to make friends with cold and rheumatism and shaking ague. Turning round a bend of the road, suddenly I see the sky lit up with a great flash of light, which blots out all its rivals on the craft lying in the channel. It is the rocket signal for the pilot. Soon it dies away, only to make the darkness more intense and the deserted road seem still more and more lonely. And now the only sound to be heard is the crunching of the grass by a horse picketted on the roadside. Still, when nearly an hour has passed, I come to a little hamlet composed of a tiny church building, a tavern, and a parsonage house, and perhaps one or two cottages, although it is impos sible to tell very clearly, for the night is darkness itself, and road lamps are unknown to the primitive inhabit ants. From the open doorway of the modest hostelry the light is streaming out, and groups of tired labourers are seen lounging and smoking, then- loud voices break-

The climate of West AustraEa is generaEy admitted to be one of the finest known. It is very dry, though with a rainfaE of about 30 inches annuaEy, and the heat is rarely oppressive. The sterdity of the country generaEy, and the prevalence of sand, is highly favourable to health, as there is Ettle luxuriant vegetation to produce miasma by its decomposition, and hardly any morasses or damp lowlands to breed ague and fever. The mortaEty of the whole colony is said to have averaged only one per cent since its formation, that of Great Britain being about two and a haE per cent. The wet season is from April to September, but during this period there is much bright, clear weather. The rest of the year is dry, but with occasional showers and thunderstorms. During three months hot land winds occur, but they are neither so frequent nor so severe as in the southern and eastern colonies, whde the great droughts and heavy floods so prevalent elsewhere are almost unknown in West Australia. Snow is unknown, and ice is only seen in the morning and in the depth of winter. With these excellent quaEties the praise bestowed on it by a writer in the Calcutta Englishman may not be exaggerated — that it is a cEmate " such as no other in the world can excel, and few equal, for comfort and health-giving attributes." As has been aEeady stated in our chapter on the Natural History of Australia, this colony possesses many striking peculiarities in its flora and fauna. Sir Joseph Hooker, in his Essay on the Flora of Australia gives many interesting detads on this subject, which we may here briefly summarise. In South-Western Australia there

The second region comprehends the temperate lands, which lie between 3,000 and 7,500 feet altitude and have a temper ature of 14° to 20° centigrade (57° to 68° Fahr.). These enjoy a mild and healthful climate, and the greater part of the population is gathered here. Finally, the cold lands are found above 7,500 feet and are formed by the summits of the highest mountains. The dif ference between the temperature of day-time and night-time is felt here most keenly. Not infrequently the ground ap pears covered with hoar-frost in the morning ; snow, how ever, is extremely rare. We shall naturally have to return several times to this division of zones. For the moment, we will limit ourselves to saying that no one of them is unhealthy — not even that of the hot lands, where the trade winds purify the air and prevent the development of endemic coast fevers. The for eigner, after a preliminary acclimatization, in submitting himself to which he is prudent, by dwelling for some time in the temperate regions of the country, can perfectly well in habit the littoral of either Pacific or Atlantic if he be rea sonably careful to avoid all excesses. We may note, however, some causes of unhealthfulness. Several great rivers of the north slope present this pecu liarity : that while their left banks are formed of dry lands free from marshes, their right banks present a succession of lagoons and localities frequently inundated, rendering them often unhealthful. The extensive clearing of lands sometimes brings with it during the first few years a little malaria ; nevertheless, per manent fever is only found in the regions of marshes, and it is but just to observe that they are usually due to errors in diet — especially to the use of the banana — rather than to miasma floating in the air. As to the insalubrity of some portions of the plateau, the cities in particular at certain seasons of the year, it may be said that this is but relative and always incidental. If

The scenery was wild and picturesque, but could not be described as grand, the river banks being low and partially wooded with small trees, varied ever and anon by one of larger growth — a majestic palm rising in solitary grandeur, its stately plume of foliage waving softly in the night wind. Now and then a slave-factory or a fetich-hut was noted as the canoe floated noiselessly on. In a little while the river narrowed to a breadth of not more than twenty yards, while its surface became covered with a wealth of marine plants, from which there arose, in a dense cloud, a reeking and noxious miasma. But the stream again broadened, the float ing plants disappeared, the vegetation on the banks grew richer and more beautiful, until the trees were so thick that they formed an arch above the heads of the voyagers that effectually shielded them from the hot sun. The river now abounded with alligators and hippopotami, while monkeys and parrots, wild ducks and other birds, were seen on all sides. On the 6th of April the two brothers reached Jenne, where they were hospitably entertained by the gover nor.

His first unfavourable impressions of the Niger had now dis appeared—no longer did he view it as the white man's sepulchre. In place of the gloomy swamps, miasma-breathing marshes, and fever-laden air which characterize the entrance of the river, his gaze now rested on magnificent virgin forests of silk-cotton and palm-oil trees. Here, the Francois glided past little hamlets of square-shaped huts set in plantations of cocoa-nut trees ; there, clearings planted with sugar cane, beans, and yams. Naked boys sported in the warm waters in the vicinity of the villages, who shouted and laughed as the steamer drew near; women carrying water from the river swelled the hubbub, while others came flying out from the houses to watch the steamer pass. Some of the men, with an eye to business, put off in their canoes and offered fish for sale to the travellers, while others quietly watched the Francais from the shore unmoved and unexcited ; and Mr. Thompson could not help thinking of the old days of African travel, when such an invasion of the black man's territory as he was now making would have been met at the spear-point. In these Niger hamlets all the work of the field seemed to be borne by the women, and our travellers constantly beheld groups of them preparing palm oil and engaged in other plantation work. The scenery of the river changed continually as the little launch

The ideas which at such times rise up in the mind are, as a matter of course, closely connected with the objects of the explorer. A plan that he may have conceived becomes a pivot upon which turn all the labours of the brain ; by day, during whole hours of abstraction, he figures to himself endless streams, colossal lakes, new tracks, and strange habitations ; by night his dreams are still of Africa, but mingled with them, the extravagances and monstrosities proper to a state of semi-conscious ness. How often when in that half- sleeping, half-waking condition have we not beheld the Cuango, coursing through a vast plain, and finally debouching into the Congo-Zaire ! How often have we not dwelt on the awful beauty of that region, and wandered through the vast basin of the immense river, noting the huge plain, here covered by many feet of water, there clothed with a dense vegetation exhaling miasma and death under a blinding, scorching sun ! We could even trace the course of the numerous rivers that flowed into the all absorbing stream ; the Cuango, the Lu-angue, the Cas sai, the Moaza-N'gombe, converging to one receptacle, where their waters intermingled ! In that same half dreamy state we found ourselves gathering information from native sources, passing through scenes of the most extravagant character, yet bearing an impress of such vivid reality, that when we were broad awake, we tried, but tried in vain to dismiss them from our mind. The map of Africa was stereotyped upon our brain, and not

With these connections, the Indian River will come into repute for vegetables. It can supply even New York in the months of January, February, and March, with the most delicate varieties — tomatoes, peas, beans, green corn, cabbages, melons, etc. I have reason to believe that varie ties of grapes can be grown here with success — the Scup pernong to perfection. The base of all Southern Florida is limestone ; this it is that prevents miasma, and it is this de composed limestone that makes the soils of that region so fertile. In describing this Indian River region it is appropriate to include the regions about Lake Worth and Key Biscayne Bay, both places being in fact a continuation of that special class of soil and products. It is hardly necessary to men tion that all this region, including the Indian River, is en tirely below the frost-line.

Another delightful variety of country found in Florida is the central lake region. There are no mountains in the State, and but few hills worthy of mention, and these few are usually in more or less unfavorable localities ; but the absence of these pleasant topographical features is com pensated by the great number of lakes, scattered thickly all through the central regions away from the seacoasts and large rivers. They are of all shapes and sizes, from ponds of an acre area in extent to spacious lakes of thirty by fifty miles dimensions, with flat, pine-clad shores, or bold bluffs, or rolling banks, or jungle-clad outlines, all pretty, and

He had learned in Peru just what appliances were necessary for hounding and torment ing savages. But he had a rough and fierce experience in Florida. The natives were numerous, bold, and enraged by the memory of the barbarities of Narvaez. Yet he was, as a matter of course, successful. He soon captured In dians enough to carry his baggage and to do the menial work of his camps, as goaded slaves. He steadily hewed on his plundering way, with an expedition to Pensacola and an invasion of Georgia. Though he received kind treatment and warm hospitality from many chiefs and their tribes, he villanously repaid it by all manner of das tardly outrages, led on and maddened by the hope of mineral treasures, and indulging in abominable debauch eries. After having been generously entertained for thirty days where now stands the town of Rome, he proceeded to ravage the neighboring country. With Indians as his bur den carriers, he entered Alabama, in July, 1540, where the natives had then their first sight of white men and horses. The pestiferous miasmas of those fair and fruitful regions proved very fatal to the Europeans, and the swamps, mos quitoes, and alligators would have overborne the fortitude and resolve of the invaders but for the passion for wealth that lured them on. The enslaved natives had to carry on litters many sick, in addition to their other burdens. De Soto had brought with him from Florida five hundred of the natives, men and women, chained and under guard. As any of these sickened or died, their places were sup plied by fresh captives from bands of the Indians who ventured to face him. The simple and bewildered natives soon lost all the dread and awe with which they would have continued to venerate the strangers, as they saw them not only reduced by common human weaknesses, but exhibiting their odious character as robbers, thieves, assassins, and cruel desperadoes. The Spaniards visited

Another enormous advantage is that, in a country where transport is difficult to procure, and scrub jungle or small trees are available, the saving of heavy and cumbrous bag gage, such as tents, is a great consideration. In the pine forest, where no scrub jungle exists, and where the timber is too large to allow of being felled, and in the parts of the country where the trees are leafless for some months, use is often made, by the Siamese and Shans, of the elephant howdahs x to sleep in, and in their construction this purpose is borne in mind. Next day, ten miles after leaving Choungnaqua, we topped the main range, and proceeding for about a mile over steep and broken ground, followed the Quay-bouk choung2 to the Main Long-gyee3 River, which at our point of crossing is a hundred feet wide and five and a half feet deep, with a very rapid current in the rains. The last mile of the distance was down a narrow valley until we came to the Hmine Long-gyee plain. The valley reaches as far as the eye can see, and is about three miles in width, consisting of grassy patches and rice cultivation. After crossing the river, we marched for about a mile across the plain to the town. 1 A howdah is a seat placed on the back of an elephant, and is generally protected by a roof. - Choung, Burmese for stream. 3 Or, Hmine Long-gyee.

All travel ling, indeed, for any distance, except by boat or elephant, is put a stop to in the rains, and for some time in the dry weather the miasma is so deadly in the hills that travelling by land through the pestifer ous districts should be restricted to from the middle of December to the beginning of May, and even then the heat has become so great that one feels as if facing a furnace. On our return journey from Zimme we felt like hunted creatures, as though we would have given anything to escape into shelter to avoid the heat from the brazen sky and the bright red hills that Avere so hot as to force our followers to Avear sandals to save their feet from blistering. McLeod mentions that the thermometer, in the country we were crossing, registered on the 18th of May 11 8° under some sheds, and 1480 in the sun. Whether we had it hotter or no, I am uncertain, but a degree or two more than we had Avould have been absolutely unbearable. A little later on the rains would have set in, and our party would have met the fate of Dr. Richard son's. He started from Labong, a town seventeen miles from Zimme, on the 29th April ; on the 9th May the rains began, and continued almost Avithout intermission during the remainder of his journey.

There was a moment's shade of gloom when I declined to take any more breakfast. There had been a kind of one on the boat, and a further trifling with one at the sta tion ; a third one, no matter how sketchy, would have been mere vanity. So, not to lose time or happy chance or the misty morning effects, I soon arranged hotel matters, and turned out again into the chill air. Smike was waiting for me, pathetic and eager. He kindly pointed out the very obvious Town hall, and remarked, " Museum." If I could have spoken Dutch fluently, I should probably have spoken it harshly to that weedy lad, but the moment's hesitation about terms sufficiently abusive gave me time to reflect. Why should I discourage the only evidence of enterprise that seemed to be awake in the place ? He was, furthermore, picturesque and quaint, and the very twin brother of the poor drudge over whom so many bitter boyish tears were shed when " Nickleby " was read for the first time — yea, even the tenth time ! This Smike was evidently no great linguist ; he had small English, and less French, and but hazy German. But why not — he looked long-suffering and defence less — why not try some elementary Dutch on him ? Poor boy, he seemed delighted with it, and understood it nearly as well as I did myself. And I, guessing at the probable replies to my own observations, could frequently understand him. We would go, then, and see the Abbey. That venerable pile at best of times is slightly shut in, and naturally somewhat damp, mouldy, and depressed ; but on this chill October morn ing, with the great, gaunt trees weeping tears of thick dew over the bed of dead leaves that strewed the soppy ground, reeking with stale miasma, it was far, far from cheerful. Artistic or an tiquarian enthusiasm needs much pumping to insure a warm or steady flow on such morning. Poor Smike left all such 13

The hot and stilling atmosphere, laden with miasma, plays terrible havoc with the health and strength of the white man. He lounges idly about the deck, longing in vain for a breath of pure sea air, the humid atmosphere pressing upon him so heavily that it is difficult to breathe, and almost impossible to work. The wily traders know all this. They visit the ship, and are profuse in apologies, explanations, and promises ; but day after day passes and but little is added to the cargo, while the men sicken one after another with a rapidity which becomes alarming. The traders board the ship less frequently, and ivory and palm-oil arrive in less and less quantities, until, in despair at the expenses he is incurring, and scaring the loss of his entire crew if he stays longer, ths captain weighs anchor and sails away. This has been the history of many a ship which has voyaged from Europe to the Gaboon, illustrating the truth of the old proverb which says that he is a bad paymaster who pays beforehand. The ship we have just seen anchor in the river will doubtless suffer a similar fate. The captain paces the deck, throwing impatient glances at either bank of the river, hoping to see laden canoes putting off; but it is hoping against hope, for none dot the water, and no signs are percejitible of any work going on on shore. At length, from a little creek, hidden by dense vegeta tion from all on board, a light canoe shoots out and ■jnakes its way to the vessel, in which is recognised a native trader, who presently climbs the side and presents himself before the captain.

There is another danger to which the unwary desert traveller is exposed. Those who have journeyed through such boundless tracts of sand report that at evening, when the tents are pitched, and preparations are made for the night, if one roams away from the camp he may chance to hear the sound of a bell, so melodious that he is irresistibly drawn to the direction from whence it comes, and wanders on and on till he finds he has lost himself. Becoming bewildered in his endeavours to retrace his steps, he strays still further away, until exhausted, he sinks down upon the hard sands, and dies in the midst of an awful silence, with no friendly hand to close his sightless eyes. Khartum is the principal centre of traffic in Nubia, and the point to which all the caravan routes converge ; it is built on the left bank of the Blue Nile. Facing the river are the Government Houses and the residence of the Governor-General of the province. Many of the streets look down from a bluff height, the houses being white washed, while here and there are extensive gardens of orange and citron trees. Stately palms add their share to the pleasant appearance of the town, and the mosque and minaret rise above the roofs of the houses. A closer acquaintance dispels a little of the charm of the place, for the streets are narrow and badly drained, while pools of water, made in the rainy season, are redolent of deadly miasma. The inhabitants, 40,000 in number, are of various nationalities — Nubians, Jews, Egyptians, Gallas Neo-roes, Turks, Greeks, and others ; added to which is a regiment of the Shillooks — of jet black hue and warlike character — in the service of the Government.

From many parts of the place you can peep through the trees upon the blue waters of Lake Biwa, — a scene in itself suffi cient to repay you for the exertions of the journey ; and if you will go beyond the monastery and climb the summit behind it, you will obtain a splendid view of the surrounding country, extend ing as far as Osaca Bay on the south (which may be seen on a clear day), and as far as the mountains of Echizen on the north ; while to the east and west endless mountain ranges stretch toward the horizon. The Buddhists are the champion monastery builders of the world. In the rugged mountains of Thibet, in Ceylon, in the islands south of Asia, in the vast provinces of China, and in Japan, you will find these stately and elaborate institutions wherever an exceptionally lovely locality is to be found. Many centuries ago have these nature loving anchorites pre-empted all the choice spots. And it must be conceded that they have rendered great service to mankind by beautifying spots and localities that otherwise would have remained wild fastnesses, and by cultivating the æsthetic part of human nature, by holding Nature herself in her loveliest moods before its gaze. Who can doubt that the thousands of peasants, who have left the slime of their native fields and the miasmas of their filthy villages, and have visited these cool retreats

" Let us enter," said my friend. " Enter ?" I asked. If they had told me that beyond that wall there was a duplicate of the famous Court of Miracles described by Victor Hugo, I should not have hesitated to believe them. No door had ever said more imperatively to me : " Keep back ! " I can find no better comparison than that of the wide open mouth of a gigantic witch, which exhaled a breath full of pestilential miasmas. However, I took courage, and entered. Oh, marvel of marvels ! It was the court of an Arabian house, surrounded by graceful little columns, sur mounted by very light arches, with those indescribable traceries of the Alhambra around the small doors and mullion windows, the beams and partitions of the ceiling sculptured and colored, niches for vases of flowers and perfume urns, the bath in the centre, and, in fact, all the traces of the delicious life of an opulent family. That house was inhabited by poor people ! We came out, entered other houses, and found in all of them some fragments of Arabian sculpture and archi tecture. Gongora said to me, from time to time : " Here there was a harem ; there the women's bath ; up there the little room of a favorite." And I fastened my hungry eyes on all those bits of arabesqued wall and the small columns of the windows, as if to ask them the revelation

Yes ; you wdl find they are not greasy, only veiy smooth- Well, those are the fatal jewels ; native here in their dust with gold, so that you may see, cradled here together, the two great enemies of mankind, — the strongest of all malignant physical powers that have tormented our race.

Was any woman, do you suppose, ever the better for possessing diamonds ? but how many have been made base, frivolous, and miserable by desir ing them ? Was ever man the better for having coffers full of gold? But who shad measure the guilt that is incurred to fill them ? Look into the history of any civilised nations ; an alyse, with reference to this one cause of crime and misery, the hves and thoughts of their nobles, priests, merchants, and men of luxurious hfe. Every other temptation is at last con centrated into this ; pride, and lust, and envy, and anger all give up their strength to avarice. The sin of the whole world is essentially the sin of Judas. Men do not disbelieve their Christ ; but they sell Him. Sibyl. But surely that is the fault of human nature ? it is not caused by the accident, as it were, of there being a pretty metal, like gold, to be found by digging. If people could not find that, would they not find something else, and quarrel for it instead ? L. No. Wherever legislators have succeeded in excluding, for a time, jewels and precious metals from among national possessions, the national spirit has remained healthy. Cove tousness is not natural to man — generosity is ; but covetous ness must be excited by a special cause, as a given disease by a given miasma ; and the essential nature of a material for the excitement of covetousness is, that it shall be a beautiful thing

The mere absence of moisture in the air, for example, would render the latter uninhabitable. We know what a part is played by the relative length of day ami night. Many are the nice adjustments needed. This great ocean of air, with its enormous mobility, rising above the mountains, not only equalizes the temperature, but is the me dium of nearly all other weather phenomena. It bears tip the clouds; its movements are the winds; it generates the storm, the lightning and the thunder. Besides its local and variable currents, grand earth currents are forever in motion ; these are laden for us with good or ill — they bring us dry weather or rain. Evaporation and distribution both depend on this all-pervading atmosphere. Very dependent are we also on its purity. It is the medium of health and sickness ; it is essential to our breathing, yet it may bear miasma into our lungs a thousand times an hour. Some writer speaks well the praises of pure air, calling it " that gaseous fooa of which we partake every minute of our lives, and without which we cannot live as many minutes, as without any other food we may live day6." The more important factors of climate are Heat, Rain and Wind. The peculiar atmospheric condition indicated by the pres ence of ozone exerts a decided influence on health and spirits. Each of these factors is very variable in its relations to time and place, varying with the season, the hour of the day, locality, etc- It is therefore almost impossible to grasp or to describe so complex a thing as the climate of a State as a whole. Averages help up, but, after all, distribution is yet more important. It deserves stress in the study of the weather, as does the sun the source, and the air, the medium of all its changes. The average temperature may be just light, yet never a comfortable day be spent, nor an influence felt favorable to veg. etation. The average rainfall may be just what is needed, yet no crops made ; the average may be made up of a succession of floods and droughts. And so it is distribution which is the important

The Campagna — Naples and its Beauties — Night View of Vesuvius — Sight-seeing — An Attempt at Robbery — Ascent of Vesuvius — Its Wonderful Eruptions — The Buried Cities. fHE accounts given of the grandeur of Mount Vesuvius- in eruption, led me to undertake an excursion to Naples, on which I was accompanied by my hostess. The time from Rome to Naples by railway is about seven hours. The route is through the Campagna, a low, unhealthy,. undulating, and uncultivated plain, which surrounds Rome. The extent is about one hundred miles long by forty miles wide. The ground rises but little above tbe sea-level, and is almost entirely volcanic, being covered with rocks, ashes, and scoriæ, thrown out at different periods. Its hikes are formed by craters of extinct volcanoes. In ancient times independent towns dotted the Campagna; but it is now bare and desolate. without trees and but few inhabitants. The streams running through these low lands are dull and sluggish. A miasma arises from the grounds, which is the cause of the much- dreaded Roman fever, which prevails during the summer months. On the west of the Campagna the ground rises higher than the Roman hills, and on the north-east the Sabine Mountains surround it like an amphitheater. Beyond these grandly rise the Apennines, with a summit like a snow-crested wall. To the south the wide plain extends to the Mediterranean, which can be distinguished by the light reflected from its waters; and through it from north to south the Tiber winds its way. On leaving the Campagna we enter the region of the Apennines, the place of many a daring adventure with bands of roving brigands, which infest the country. These men often enter the surrounding towns in disguise and mingle

Huge cremation-towers now re ceive all bodies cast upon its waters, whence the never dying flames are seen constantly ascending, dark and lurid, toward the tranquil blue sky. The town of Calcutta lies on the eastern bank of the Hoogley, which is the eastern arm of the old Ganges, and held almost as sacred as that river ; the natives daily re pair in great numbers to its banks to offer up prayers aud praises. Here also, amid the din and noise and hurry of native craft, trading vessels, and all manner of river com merce, may be seen at any hour of the day or night the sick and dying of the Hindoo population stretched on the edge of the river's banks, half immersed in the sacred stream, their faces turned to the sky, convulsed or calm, breathing their lives away. At high water the Hoogley is nearly a mile broad in front of the town, and is very pleasant to look upon. Fine ships and steamers of all nations and countries lie here within sight and sound ; picturesque-looking craft of every kind are seen gliding swiftly hither and thither. But at low water the scene suddenly changes ; the river becomes a shrunken and muddy ghost of itself, with filthy borders, whence myriad floating particles of miasma are wafted on the air to the poor humanity who are doomed to live and labor in its vicinity. After passing the triumphal archway you emerge on a spacious open area called the Meidan, or plain ; here all the principal roads part aud meet, and here on either side one sees a grand display of really stately architecture. This is the handsome and fashionable suburb of Chow ringee, and in every respect worthy of being called, as it is, " the City of Palaces." The houses are all Euro pean, three and four stories high, some detached, others 20

"So, what with fever o' mind, and yellow fever, he's food for the land crabs, that's sartain." — Capt. Marryat, R.N. (Jacob Faithful). "The foul miasma of the dying jungle, the poisonous breath of the leaves, shed from her thousand trees, and lying in every stage of decomposition around." — Florence Marryat. So far as perfection be attainable in any climate, it may be said in general terms of that of South Africa that it leaves little to be desired, and in fact arrives as near perfection as any climate can. True, if I were to speak of my own individuality, I should be inclined to take exception to this flattering character, but a man who is constitutionally opposed to even a moderate degree of heat is not in the reckoning, and I therefore fully endorse the judgment of others on this point, for I consider it to be a just and proper judgment. Sir Bartle Frere hit the right nail on the head when he said, " The climate of South Africa was generally far superior to that of the South of Europe, and reminded him of some of the best parts of the South of France, and was free from some of the drawbacks which detracted from the salubrity of the latter places ". For patients suffering from pulmonary complaints, nothing could possibly come up to the climate of South Africa. It beats the South of France by many lengths. You come across men in the colonies at every turn, who assure you that they would

But in the tables of mortality, neither these constant shocks, nor the equally constant politi cal disturbances, are credited with the short precarious tenure of human life in Lima. Like the inhabitants of some other cities we know of, they are their own deliberate murderers. They persist in trying to breathe air tainted by foul smells and decay, and bad water, and the result of the experiment is not encouraging, for those who are strong enough to fight the battle for existence against the evil-smelling heats bred from miasma and filth, become poor weak de generate creatures, whilst the more delicate individuals give up the struggle and die young. The native dark races still linger round the ruined and overgrown temples and dwellings where their forefathers lived and worshipped, and the Tables of' Returns for both Lima and Quito show a large pro portion of Indian inhabitants. Hewers of wood and drawers of water have these people become to their conquerors, but they still cherish the early traditions of their race, and look forward to a millennium — a time when Manco Capac and Mama Oello, the son and daughter of the Sun, will return to restore the old Inca dynasty, which they founded four centuries before the Spanish invasion and conquest of Peru. Some of the aborigines utterly refuse to adapt themselves to the strange faith and rule of the new comers, and prefer to wander, like gipsies, over the province, subsisting by selling balsams, herbs, and barks. There is one tribe in particular, called the Callavayas or Yungenas, which may be said to have

" To this the stereotyped answer runs : " There is no news ; I heard some lies only." From Kolobeng, as we stated before, the route had been due north, leaving Lake Ngami on the west, and by the ist March they reached Kamakama, where no stay was made, as the pools along the route were dry ing up, and whence the road trended westwards. Ten days later the miasma from these stagnant, rapidly absorbed pools of rain-water caused fever to appear in the camp, and delayed them for more than a week. As soon as the sick had sufficiently recovered to be placed in the waggons, the expedition continued its course without halting, until the little hill N'gwa was reached. It is only 300 or 400 feet high, but appeared a lofty mountain to eyes accustomed for so long to a level plain. From this point the country became very beautiful, well-wooded and grassed, traversed by water-courses almost big enough to be called rivers. At last the Sanshureh River was reached and crossed — where the Chobe runs into it — with some difficulty, on a pon toon, the waggons being taken to pieces and carried over on canoes lashed together. In order to avoid the flooded lands to the north of the Chobe, they now turned sharp to the west, and on the 23rd May reached Linyanti, the capital town of the Makololo, and only a short distance from their camp of 1 85 1. Here the good Missionary halted, and attempted to teach and tame the wild people about him. Their progress was but slow, the alphabet proving a formidable asses-bridge to the dusky scholars.

This much-abused mistral has been christened by the know ing peasantry ' lou bon vents It really is a public bene factor, for this 'prince of the power' of the air clears the country from damp and miasma, and is therefore one of the great sanitary features of the seaboard. The streams of a coast Avhich slopes so directly to the sea must run from north to south. They have their sources among the everlasting snows, but their outfall is among the sun-dried sands. It is the incessant currents of air, all these angels of the Avinds, ascending and descending the valleys and river-beds of Provence, that make and keep the country healthy. Thanks to them avc have here no Maremma with its fatal beauty of midsummer, and no Pontine marshes, Avith their fevers and agues. The southern exposure of this beach causes an almost daily phenomenon in the matter of the Avind. ToAvards the dawn a tramontana, which the boatmen call ' lou vent de la neige,' rises, and they may then be seen hugging the land, while in the same way if the wind sets due south they will run close in shore, to catch a ricochet off hills which deflect the wind enough to give it a slight change of direction. These experienced judges are of opinion that it is the SE. wind, ' lou vent de mer,' which brings the finest weather, particularly if, turning to ' vent de soleu,' it goes round all day with the sun. They also denominate this veering wind ' lou vent dou mal hourous,' because their sails are like the pockets of an unlucky man, empty after having been full. The SSE. wind, the Siroc, blows in the upper regions of the air. It

I am sure that if some enterprising English man would boil, pickle, and send out to Greece the cuttle fish we throw away in disgust, his fortune would be made. The damp of Panachrantos and the sudden changes of temperature on our journey, had now asserted themselves, and before reaching Gavrion that evening symptoms of fever had set in. Nature, not art, cured me, for Gavrion does not possess a doctor, only a deaf old man who knew something about herbs, and whose presence half-a-dozen times a day in my room was worse than the fever. I think he fancied I was going into a consumption— a common disease, I believe, in Andros, and which the peasants believe to be the Erinys, who sits at the four corners of the death-chamber ready to seize on any who come near. Hence consumption is said to be infectious; children and newly married people, whom it is supposed the Erinys chiefly attack, are forbidden to come near the sick-chamber. Of all places in the world Gavrion is one of the most desolate. A few houses are dotted along the shore of a spacious land-locked harbour ; before these houses stand tall wooden erections that look like gallows, but they are merely places on which to dry the bodies of the octo podiain the sun and wind. There is not a tree in sight, only a marshy plain dangerous from its miasma in sum mer, but when we were there a perfect garden of sweet smelling narcissus. The most interesting sight we saw at Gavrion, on the Saturday after we arrived and the first day I was able to get up, was a troop of Albanian peasants, who came in this day to have their cases of litigation settled. The Greeks say that they are ten times more quarrelsome than themselves, and bring their

When from seamed trunk and gnarled limb the resurrec tion-fern burst forth in living green, when the hibiscus glowed on margin of swamp and pond, and the splendor of the magnolia grandiflora paled before the advancing glories of the blazing-star, when on the ground and all about and in the loftiest growth of the forest, were flung out the floral signals of lurking peril — the troops fled for very life from the miasma, and withdrew to the summer stations on the coast; and then, in his swampy fastnesses secure from molestation, the Indian tended his crops, celebrated his green corn dance, and gathered new strength for the winter warfare. The Seminole made a desperate stand for his Florida home. He was exacting from the whites a terrible price for the acres they coveted. And even more desperately than the Indian, fought the negro fugitive. Defeat for him was not the loss of land, but of liberty; to yield meant not exile, but bondage. But hopeless was the struggle. As time went on, the strength of Indian and ally surely waned; year by year their numbers grew less. Some were killed, some taken in battle. More were cap tured by ruse and treachery and violations of flags of truce. The Indian was a savage — not entitled to the consideration accorded a civilized foe. He refused to be vanquished in fair fight; the war, then, must be brought to an end by other means. Special efforts were made to capture the chiefs, Osce- ola and Coacoochee. When these two influential leaders 8

There are a few small undulating hills in the bottom of the valley, which is bounded by mountains well wooded or covered with long grass. There are plenty of vUlages, with a good many trees round them, and the landscape is more varied than any we had seen for some time. From the rapidity of the river, and the undulating nature of the ground, it might have been supposed that this district would be healthy enough ; but the secrets of the red miasma must remain hidden yet awhde in the recesses of the beautiful, but deadly vale. The river is crossed by a chain suspension bridge of two spans, the second span in a line parallel to the continuation of the first, but about four yards from it on the same level. This system is probably adopted for the greater facdity given for tightening up the chains ; but it makes a mis-shapen affair of what would otherwise be a well-constructed bridge. The eastern span was about seventy-three and the western fifty -two yards long ; each span is supported on twelve or fourteen chains underneath, and two above, the links being of three-quarter-inch iron, one foot long. At the time of our visit it was in excellent repair, but the eastern span, destroyed by the Ma hometans during the rebellion, had only recently been rebuilt. At the time of Baber's visit it was ' in a dangerous state of dilapidation.' The stream was running rapidly below the eastern span, but the western was quite dry. We halted at Lu-Chiang-Pa, a little village about a quarter of a mile beyond the end of the bridge, and here at 10.30 a.m. the thermometer marked 80° Fahr. Baber noticed the sultriness of this place, for on April 29 his thermometer registered 96° Fahr.

The awful presence of Thy might, Thy wrath, Thy majesty — the horror of despair — The awe of judgment, torment, wailing, woe — The midnight of the future, like a pall — 'Tis on my soul, with all the agony And utter desolation of the lost. Thy burden is too heavy for me, Lord, Oh ! I am crushed and weary unto death ; Oh ! let me see Thy face no more, dear God, Until my fainting soul, unearthed, has gained A God-like power, a more than mortal strength.

I raised myself ; the scene was all unchanged ; The damp, morbose sudations of the earth Commingled with the dank miasma of the marsh, Clung with a mucid chillness round my frame, And drizzled from my moulting hair and beard In drops of humid, fetid dew, upon The saturated robe which clogged my frame ; A mortal dampness chilled me to the soul. I shivered, shivered with an inward gasp, And shrank into a heap from the cold damp, That like a cloud of fog enwrapt me round. 1

Meanwhile the sore-tormented, leafless trees, Planted along the dark, forsaken quays, With deprecating sobs, fling out their arms, And rock and tremble, pictures of despair, Entreating pity from the ruthless blast That fain would throttle every living thing That stands between it and its mad career, Of curst miasma and malignant spite !

Every legend of the Miamis, every reminiscence of our pioneers, point out the St. Joseph country as a happy valley. Fish swarmed in its lakes and rivers, deer and bears in its forests, wild fruits flourished upon its prairies, and primeval happiness dwelt in its villages; but the hour at length came when the child of art arrived to possess himself of all these. Then the untamed children of the forest were driven to seek other homes, and with their departure the fish and forest animals may be said to migrate; for where Nature supplied her worshipers hitherto, she willed that the white man should only be rewarded in proportion to his industry, and thus left him to extract from the soil just so much as his labor warranted, and little of that great all which was shared by the lazy and bar barous aborigines. That he has succeeded in improving upon nature in this respect is manifest. Though the rivers do not contain myr iads of large fish, or the forests wild animals, or the prairies do not yield wild fruits now as in days long past, it will be seen that the waters, turned into other channels, set a hundred mill-wheels turn ing; the trees of the forest have been converted into substantial buildings, substructures for the iron rail or devoted to other branches of industry, and the prairies bend, as it were, under the weight of golden grain, the seeds of which were planted by man and reared up a hundred-fold to perfection by nature. Romance alone can feel any sorrow for the change. It is progress pure and simple, and in its advance the pioneers were the principal actors. 2U

Getting good Avay on our boat, the oars were unshipped, and a preconcerted signal agreed upon for opening fire. Foot by foot we steadily approached, till but thirty-five paces intervened, when each aiming low, our two right-hand barrels responded to the pres sure on the trigger, cutting a lane through the uncon scious broad bills, and as they rose, almost with the voice of thunder, off the water, each left-hand barrel repeated the performance, bringing down in all attitudes maimed and wounded. Over thirty birds fell to this fusilade, and among their numbers was to be found almost every variety, from the handsome plumaged widgeon and teal to the larger mallard. Except on American prairies, in autumn and spring, at the periods of migration, I know of no place where such fine duck-shooting can be obtained as here ; but the preference, even if the numbers should be much less, must be given to America, for few of our race can continue to breathe the noxious miasmas that night and morning arise from the paddy-fields without his consti tution and health becoming seriously impaired. In fact, two of the gentlemen who then shot with me found pre mature graves, and in each instance their medical at tendants affirmed that they had contracted the disease which had deprived them of life by their too-frequent trips in pursuit of their favourite sport. Our work commenced successfully, and how often does a good dc'bt'it tend to make us continue to perform well ; both shot better than usual, and it soon appeared that we had but to point our guns to cut down the swift-

During early summer little evil arises from using the water of these cisterns, the heavier particles settling to the bottom ; towards autumn, how ever, the water gets low, the buckets in descending stir up the deposit, and the mixture wThich thousands then have to use as their daily beverage is too horrible to think of. It is at this time that a miasma appears to rise from the refuse, and that the fever season commences. It is difficult to obtain statistical infor mation in Jerusalem, but one fact alone will show the unhealthy nature of the city : the Jewish population is estimated at about 9000, yet in twelve months more than 13,000 cases of sickness were attended to in their own hospital and that of the Protestant Mission. Much relief might be obtained by the adoption of a few simple sanitary precautions ; every cistern should be well cleaned once a year and the refuse removed to a distance, instead of being thrown in front of the door to be carried back to the cistern by the first shower. The roofs and terraces of the houses should be well swept, and the w-ater from them made to pass through wire-gauze or some simple filtering apparatus before entering the cistern. Intimately connected with the water supply is the drainage of the city, of which it is hardly too much to say that there is none. Those drains which exist are little more than cess-pits, and, except after heavy rain, there is no discharge from the mouth of the present main. Few cities have more facilities for good drainage than Jerusalem, and it seems formerly to have been as well managed as the water supply,

Between Sao Miguel, sezoes, or fever and ague, were exceedingly prevalent, and I left all my canoe-men sick at Salto Grande. There was scarcely a house on the river where there were not cases of fever, and canoes on the up voyage were delayed at the Salto and elsewhere along the route because of the sickness of the crews. This general prevalence of fever among the canoe men is principally attributable to their exceeding impru dence. They drink freely of the warm muddy river-water when overheated. They bathe in it under the hot sun, and go with dripping garments a great part of the time, spend ing frequently night after night under drenching rains with no other shelter than a woollen blanket. I had risen from a sick-bed to make the voyage, and was constantly exposed to the rain and cold ; but I avoided the river-water, and es caped, as did my fellow-traveller, a merchant from Calhao.* The hills comprising the Serra da Lua Cheia are of con siderable altitude, much broken up and very irregular in outline. In this serra are several conspicuous needles visible from a long distance, two of which are named respectively the Enchadao and Enchadinho. From this serra to the dangerous Caxoeira de Santa Anna, formerly called the Caxoeira do Inferno, the river is very rapid, full of islands, and there are some places difficult to pass. The Caxoeira de Santa Anna is at all times so dangerous that the cargo is always carried round the rapids, and re embarked below, the canoe descending empty. At the head * I cannot let pass this opportunity of acknowledging the kindness of this gentleman, Senhor Baretto, a mulatto, who gave me my passage to the Salto from Calhao, and was of the greatest service to me.

Although, in fact, only five thousand Confederates were stationed there, the Fed eral leader suspected traps ahead, and so went for a month to vigorous spading, road-making, and mining, resuming in this way his early occupations and tastes. These gratified, and no traps found, the army began on the 3d of May to move towards the Chickahominy, — a sluggish, soupy stream, thickened by swamp muds and miasma, — which was reached May 20th and crossed. There was now more spading, and in sight of the Eichmond spires. For six weeks, alas ! the spade was busy, not for the bving only, through this Golgotha of the war ; for now commenced a series of death-dealing combats sel dom equalled in our web-mounded planet : May 27th the battle of Hanover Court-House, the Confederates losing ; fobowed by four days of severe skirmishes ; succeeded by the gigantic struggle of forty-eight un ceasing hours of death-heaping on both sides, at Fair Oaks Station, between the corps of Sumner, Heintzelman, Kearny, and Hooker, on one side, and Joseph E. Johnston, the Confederate commander, Long street, and the two Hihs, on the other ; then three weeks of intrenching, sickness, and decimation; and then on the 25th of June, the retreat to the James, crowded with six days of ceaseless combats, embroid ering in gloriously ensanguined characters on the shredding flag of the Potomac the well-fought but disastrous battles of Mechanicsvibe, Gaines's Mdls, Savage's Station, White-Oak Swamp, and Malvern Hill, in which fifteen thousand Union fives were spent. 0

The fall of their leader did not relax the exertions of the Missourians. They made good all their Senator had said of them, and continued to fight several hours longer, until the Indians were entirely vanquished. The loss in killed and wounded was one hundred and twelve, most of whom were Missourians. There being no further service required of the Missourians, they were returned to their homes early in 1838, and the name and fame of General Gentry placed where it will never perish. A pleasing incident was witnessed by the sick and wounded Missourians on their journey homeward that deserves a place in history, and may be found in the journals of St. Louis of that date : After the battle of Okeecho-bee General Taylor ordered the sick and wounded of his army, in the field-hospital, to be removed to Pensacola for their more comfortable accommo dation. They were conveyed to Tampa Bay and embarked on board a steamboat and arrived near sundown at Pensacola, where the most fashionable people had made preparations for a most splendid ball in honor of the recent victory ; and the ladies were making their toilets, preparing for the soiree, when it was announced that the wounded had arrived from the battle field to find hospitals among them. The ladies, as if by preconcerted arrangement, at once quit their toilets, threw open the doors of their mansions and hast ened with their carriages to the steamboat offering their houses for hospitals and themselves as nurses to the sick and wounded. It is unnecessary to say there was no dancing that evening, but a strife to save what of life remained from the hands of the savages and the more death-bearing miasma of the swamps of Florida. When the Missourians were able' to travel, they parted with their kind benefactors and returned in small squads to their former homes, bearing- in their grateful ; bosoms a lasting remembrance of the kind attentions of the ladies of Pensacola.

The West Indians are glad to observe that at least a portion of the English press correctly appreciates the true bearing of the negro question, though they add despondingly it is too late ; the mischief has been done ; our planters have been ruined ; our merchants have gone away ; capital will never flow back in our time ; we have been sacrificed to a sentiment ; and we, our children, and grandchildren have been im poverished to prop up the absurd anthropological theory that the white and the black races are equal, a theory which nobody can maintain for a moment in the face of the facts he sees around him. Panama, since I visited it in 1848, has much im proved, owing principally to the railway from Colon, which connects the traffic of the Atlantic with that of the Pacific Ocean. A great part of this railway goes through swamps, and is a noble monument of Ame rican enterprise. It is well known that but few of the natives could be induced to work on this great high way of nations, and that labour had to be imported from other parts, principally China ; and when the rank swamp vegetation came to be disturbed, fearful miasmas arose, and such was their pernicious effect upon the workmen that every foot of the road cost a human life. The Chinese coobes took a most despond ing view of the task the Americans had set before them, and every morning dozens were found suspended on the trees, so that a guard had to be set over them to prevent their committing self-destruction during the night. But American energy finally triumphed over every obstacle, and they have now the best pay ing railway in the world.

The most effective and decisive work, however, for the development of the entire region, would be created by the extraordinary reconnaissance referred to on another page. This subject I propose to notice elsewhere. On every side, the slow but constant progress of im provement and cultivation is invading the wilderness. The pioneer of agriculture is each year occupying the haunts of the hunter, and gradually supplanting him. The valuable towu of Greig, iu Lewis county, now embrac ing a population of about nineteen hundred inhabitants, has within comparatively a few years, been carved from the silent forest. This wilderness is distinguished for the healthiness of its climate. There prevails in the atmosphere, which envelops these mountains, a pureness, an elasticity and vitality that imparts health, and affords an indescribable physical enjoyment iu the mechanical process of inspira-* tion ; the lungs are filled, and perform their functions without effort or labor. In my explorations of the coun try, I have met with repeated instances of iudividuals, who had reached their forest homes, in advanced stages of pulmonary affection, in whom the disease had been arrested, and the sufferer restored to comparative health. They uniformly imputed the change to the influence of the atmosphere, and to the soothing and invigorating effect of the peculiar property referred to. No invalid enters these solitudes without experiencing upon his sys tem this strengtheuiug and reuovatiug influence. The atmosphere can be impregnated by no noxious miasmas, but is poured down from the summits of these stately mountains, fresh and pure, and life giving as it comes from the laboratory of nature. Parts of the southern section of this territory in. Warren and Hamilton counties, particularly where the lofty group of Mt. Seward upheave aud dislocate the surface, are high,

He is cold, taciturn, or talks little, and on his return home notably clad in his brown cloak, with his sombrero drawn over his face, he looks much more like a country hidalgo than a coal-miner. The Asturian grafts on to the qualities of the Castilian others of a stdl austerer kind ; and he is, also, a better workman and more inured to fatigue. His habits seem to borrow theh tone from the ruggedness of his native mountains. In the south of Spain, the less energetic Andalusian has preserved somewhat of the costume and nonchalance of the Moor, who formerly possessed the country ; but stid he is a capital miner. In southern Europe there is another type full of character, which must be mentioned ; the Italian coal-miner, especially the migratory miner of the Tuscan Maremma, a district once flourishing and populous, and one of the granaries of ancient Borne, but now, at certain seasons of the year, a prey to fever and miasma. From July tdl October it would decimate the miners, and the codiery is, therefore, closed during those four months, the works being carried on without interruption during the re maining interval. The migratory labourers employed in the mountains of Pistoja, on the healthy flanks of the Apennines, leave theh country by hundreds after autumn, when the weather begins to get cold and snow may soon be expected. Old Niccolini, the mine-agent, goes to hire them beforehand, and to pay the earnest-money. The exodus begins soon after the middle of October ; some going on foot, whde others ride, seeking places in the calessini or stage-coaches. They come alone, leaving wives and chddren at home, for too many victims must not be exposed to the malaria, or deadly ah of the Maremma. The opening operations, which are soon begun, are impeded
002792348	002792348_403	396 CLIMATE OF DAMASCUS. The climate of Damascus may be considered moderate, for the palm of the south and the walnut of the north grow together. No winter passes without occasionally forming a cake of ice on the fountains; and in some winters snow lies on the ground for several days. The spring is delightful beyond description. When I first arrived at Damascus the leaves had scarcely budded, and I felt disappointed, for my imagination could not fill up the blank in the landscape; but, as the season advanced, and clothed the gardens with verdure and foliage, I felt constrained to admit the surpassing beauty of the environs in spring. In summer the heat during the day is usually thirty degrees of Eeaumur in the shade, and twenty-five in the apartments with stone walls and fountains. The Damascenes suffer very little from the hot desert winds, for, before arriving at the city, they have to pass through and over many miles of thick vegetation ; on the other hand, the chalky rocks in the vicinity raise the temperature. In August, Septem ber, and the first half of October, there is miasma and much fever. Landed property in the neighbourhood of the town generally produces six per cent., but some land is so heavily taxed by the Miri, or public treasure, that very little is derived from it. It is also worthy of remark, that, in disputes between the landlord and tenant, the committee of persons who are entrusted with these agricultural matters, and who have to make their in quiries on the spot, are usually more inclined to favour the interest of the tenant than of the landlord. When a tenant has been three years settled on land, it is very

Hecker observes that at the time of the Black Death, in the fourteenth century, the foundations of the earth were shaken from China to the Atlantic ; and that throughout Europe and Asia the atmosphere, by its baneful influence, endangered both animal and vegetable life. The German chroniclers inform us that at this time a thick stinking mist advanced from the east, and spread itself over Italy ; and, it is stated that previously to an earthquake, at the same time, a pestiferous wind blew in Cyprus of such a deadly nature, that thousands fell down and expired in great agonies. The Black Death of the fourteenth century, so called from the black spots or putrid decomposition of the skin, is stated to have carried off in the East 37,000,000 of human beings, and in Europe in the same proportion to its population. This destructive pestilence is beautifully described by Boc cacio, in the introduction to the Decameron. One writer states that infection and contagion have their origin in animalculæ ; and, therefore, their infancy, maturity, and decline. The bubo of the plague is full of them. And Cooper says, " If this opinion be well founded, it is no wonder that a chemical examination of the atmosphere cannot detect miasma, which does not depend on the state of the atmosphere." "Is not contagion," says Dr. Dwight, " such a fermentation of an animal body as generates ani malculæ, and hence the danger of contact; and is not exemption after infection, evidence that the germs in that subject have been exhausted." The plague generally manifested itself by the febrile

In summer, the houses of the natives, and the hedges round them, are covered over with climbing gourds or calabash plants. Maize, sugar-cane, and pumpkins also grow in every available corner round the houses. When viewed from the adjoining mountain, the town thus clothed in green is really beautiful. But however charming in the distance, it is not at all pleasant to thread those narrow, winding, and gourd-shaded lanes. When dady returning from school soon after noon, I found the atmosphere of the town to be quite oppressive, and constantly wondered that cases of fever were not even more numerous. Early in 1865, I had an attack of African fever, no doubt induced by constant exposure to this miasma. I had recourse to strong measures, dosing myself at once with Livingstone's prescription, and was only a few days ati invalid. I have elsewhere described some of the symptoms of this disease. About this time a Matebele soldier made his appearance at Sekhome's as a refugee, being accompanied by one of those women who occupy the station of " wives of the chief" in the country of the Matebele. The man was well received by Sekhome, and a place appointed for him in the town. Every day, however, he came to my house, ostensibly because he had known me in his own country. But I soon learned from him the true cause of his coming so often : he was afraid of being put to death by the Bamangwato, but thought he would he safe as long as he was on my premises. ' I did my best to assure him that he was in no danger. By and bye I missed the tall handsome soldier from his usual place in my yard ; and in a few days I learned that he had hanged himself.

The fervent Catholic rejoices at Rome. It is his Mecca, his Medina, in one. Eome is to him more than Jerusalem ; for in Eome he is still master, and there are no hated Greeks, no loathed schismatics to jostle him while he worships at the Holy Places. Has he not at Borne the Scala Santa, the very steps of Pilate's house ? Is not the Holy Cratch, the manger board, at Eome ? Are not the Apostle's chains here ? and the very prisons and the tombs of Peter and St. Paul : not in the insolent keeping of a Turkish pasha, but under the sacred guardianship of the successor of St. Peter himself? The Eomanist at Eome est dans son pays. He is monarch of all he surveys. To M. Louis Veuillot the foul stenches and miasma of modern Eome are so many sweet perfumes — " Parfum de Eome ;" whereas in the boudoirs of tbe Chaussee d'Antin and the parterres of Madame Prevost the austere moralist can scent only the most shocking odours. He plumes himself on Eome, for it is the only city in Europe where the shovelled hat takes precedence of the lady's bonnet ; where men in petticoats have the pas over women in the like articles ; where a snuffy old Monsignore is a greater leader of fashion than a Eussian princess ; or a parchment-faced vicar-general from Peru is more run after than a Japanese ambassador. It is nearly the only city where swarms of cowled - and - shaven menks are permitted to pervade the streets ; and where once a year a wooden idol — the Bambino

There was a flavor of Spanish about everything, however; the food, the churches, the stores, the town generally ; decayed, effete, luxuriant, tropical Spanish. The na tives were a good deal mixed, bearing all the mu latto shades; the women flaunting in narrow, sleazy white gowns, rich with wide negro ruffles and furbe lows ; and the children rollicking in single, short, wide chemises, or unblushing and bold with utter absence of covering. The churches, ancient, cheap and moss grown, won no veneration except for their antiquity ; they told of no interest in religion; of nothing but a tawdry, vulgar fanaticism ; a lazy, cock-fighting priest hood, and an indifferent parish. We found the bats flying about in the arches above and behind the altar, and priests and boys firing guns at them, among the poor tinselry of the worship, with results more dam aging to "bell, book and candle" than birds. At mid-day, the long and crowded passenger train started across the Isthmus, — treasure and baggage waited for a second, — and we had that ever-memo rable ride, in the experience of all who have ever made this trip, between the Continents, from Ocean to Ocean, in the very fullness of the tropics, over rails fairly built upon human bodies, so fatal was the miasma of the country to nearly all classes of im ported laborers. The road is fifty miles long, and the run is made in two to three hours. Monopolizing the commerce of all the Pacific Coast of both North

We pass by the thick and sinuous Chagres River, up and down which in flat-boats the early passengers by this route were pushed by the negro ; along whose banks in this slow and painful passage many laid down to die; and out of whose fetid breath came many a long-lurking and finally fatal fever. The passage is now made so quickly in the cars, that there is little danger at any season of taking the fever of the country. We came into Aspinwall, in the first rain storm that we had felt since rain and hail pelted us so mer cilessly on the Plains near Fort Kearney, nearly four months before, and found that a dreary new town of one street, lined with hotels and shops and Jamaica negroes and negresses. These people are proof against this climate; they luxuriate and thrive from the start here, and it was due to their importation that the Railroad was finally completed, as it was, after all other importations, white and black alike, had fallen in their tracks along its line of rotting nature, stirred to revengeful miasma by shovel and pick. Aspinwall has no past like Panama, no present and no future but what the Railroad and Steam-ships make for it ; and we welcomed the summons to the new steamer for New York. The finest of weather, and the quickest trip ever made from the Isthmus to New York, — six and a half days, — waited upon us. The September equi- 32

It was "the exaggerated report of this mishap by the Kytch to the missionaries at Santa Croce (their station, south of Lolnun) that resulted in the communication of our deaths by the late Mrs. Tinne, then with her adventurous daughter and suite at that place, on their way to Gondokoro.

When, by crossing the last river, he actually stood upon it, he dropped the merchant's dress, arrayed himself in the brown Capuchin robe, and, with his companions, fell on his knees to chant a Te Deum. He was not without adventures with wild beasts. One morning before daylight, as he walked alone in advance of his companions to recite his prayers, through a bamboo thicket on the crest of a hill he heard the soft step of a leopard as it .trod over the fallen leaves. He wrapped himself from head to foot in a large piece of linen that he had with him, leaving only room to look out, while he clasped his crucifix the closer, and began to pray very earnestly to God. While his heart beat like a hammer, he saw the leopard turn when it came near, look fixedly towards him, and then pass on. He once ran out of a burning prairie followed by a train of wild animals — leopards, antelopes, and serpents — that sought, like him and his com panions and their faithful asinello, to escape. The donkey had his legs and tail burnt, and a large serpent, although it made prodigious leaps for ward and upward over the burning reeds and plants, fell at last into that furnace, and was con sumed. The natives are accustomed, in order to clear the prairies of serpents and animals, and also to prevent the vegetable matter from decaying after the rains and producing miasmas, to set the dry grass and shrubs on fire, keeping themselves out of its track. But that day the wind blew

To our great regret, as he spoke no West European language, and we no Russian, our communications were com paratively limited ; but even the conversation carried on through an interpreting friend enabled us to per ceive that he was well read, not only in military matters, but in general history and literature. He had a particular admiration for Cromwell, about the recent lives of whom he questioned us, and dis coursed with great acuteness as well as knowledge on European politics and literature, including the works of two writers who seem to be favourites in Russia, the late Mr. Buckle and Mr. Herbert Spencer. Although a strict teetotaller himself, as a good Mus lim ought to be, his table was well supplied with the choicest wines of Transcaucasia, as well as with a liquor to which the prohibition of the Prophet is supposed not to apply, and which, in spite of its high price, is largely consumed in these countries, English bottled porter. His house was spacious, with large, low rooms, all on the ground floor, and by closing the shutters we were able to get some cool during the day, especially as a slight breeze rose in the after noon.

Lesseps has got in this town a residence for his family-, and entertains, with great generosity, travellers remaining there, or passing through Egypt. Around this town are patches of planting, made so as to induce rain to fall, which has been partially successful. There has also been planted various specimens of the "Eucalyp tus globulus," a tree which grows in mild climates as O ' o rapidly in eight years as an oak will do in forty. It renders marshy grounds healthy by absorbing miasma, and the aroma, from its leaves, prevents diseases, both of fever and cholera, taking place near the planting. As we passed down, nearing Suez, the thermometer reached about S2° in the shade, and requires passen gers to use their tropical clothes, and take care to remain out of the sun, and under the double awning of the ship. As we now approach the Gulf of Suez, we look, at a considerable distance, upon the moun tains of Mount Ephraim and Manassa in the direction of Mount Sinai, and to those who are acquainted with ancient and Egyptian history, thoughts are recalled of a nature not soon to be forgotten. We pass also an island called the Brothers, and learn from those on board, that the Red Sea is now so well planted with lighthouses, that it may be likened to the method in which the streets of a large city are lighted.

The utility of this manner of making meadow, in a sanitary point of view, is very questionable ; the miasma arising from the stagnant water and from exposed vegetable matter, incident to the system, is una voidable ; it spreads disease through the entire neighborhood, and very much lessens the value of property within its baneful influence. The owner erected a substantial brick house, which, at the time it was built, ranked among the best in this section ; but, when compared with the present system of architecture, it appears insignificant enough. This house still stands, and shows at a glance the many years that have passed away since its erection. In front of and at a short distance from it, may be seen the ditch and bank that surrounded the park for deer, which cov ered many acres of land and extended to the south branch of the creek. On the bank stood a high and substantial fence, that effectually prevented the game from escaping when once within its bounds; and there the owner and his invited friends could find excellent sport at any season of the year. Connected also with the place was a race course, where the speed of the pretentious horses iri the neighborhood could be tested, and where, doubtless, the conceit was often taken out of various owners and backers, who resorted thither to fleece a jockey disguised as a greenhorn. All these prove not only that the owner was a man of wealth, but also that, in its enjoyment, the drift of his inclination brought around him a class of associates that had similar tastes. William Albertson was an active man in the affairs of the colony, and, besides holding other positions of public trust, was returned as a member of the Assembly in 1685.15 He was for several years a member of the council of proprietors, and at a time when men of the best judgment were called upon to act in that capacity.16 In the affairs of the township his name is often seen, which shows that he looked after the interests of his neighbors as well as the enjoyments of his own estate. 15 Learning & Spicer's Laws. 16 Minutes of Council, O.

The immediate neighbourhood of Weymouth not abound ing with trees, — however regretted by the healthy, who may consider them in an ornamental light, or as affording a grateful shade — is in reality a circumstance much in its favor, as a place of resort for the sick and weak ; as trees not only obstruct the free circulation of the air, but often cause disease, by the miasma arising from their exhalations and dcayed vegetation. From the pier, at the entrance of the harbour, there is an uninterupted view of the Esplanade, the sands, and the bay. Steamers cross to and from Portland continually during the day, they also make frequent excursions to and from Lulworth, Swanage, Bournmouth, the Isle of Wight, Torquay, Dartmouth, &c., affording to visitors an opportunity of viewing the ex tensive Breakwater, and of enjoying a pleasant trip on the water. Here also are yachts and pleasure boats, of various descriptions, for the convenience of those who prefer that mode of enjoying a treat on the water, which can at all times be brought close to the quay, the descent to them is by steps, and are commanded by licensed watermen. THE NOTHE which is, fortified in the most substantial manner, forms a protion of a chain of works for the pro tection of the harbour of refuge, situated on the south side of the harbour, a short distance from any part of the town, and is a convenient agreeable walk, well suited to the limited powers of the weak or invalided, (or it can be reached by boats from the quay).

Banias wore an air of life during our visit to which it is not accustomed. It so happened that the greater part of the Palestine travelers of the season met there. Fifty-two European and American pilgrims, ladies as well as gentlemen, encamped, in four parties, on the grounds about the village and its fountain. The nu merous tents, flying flags of England, America and Germany, and the large body of retainers, with the horses, mules and donkeys, made quite a stirring show. The villagers, however, did not seem prone to manifestations of lively curiosity. They gazed at us with but a languid interest in their sallow faces, which tell of the fevers that prevail in the autumn, engendered by miasma from the plain and marsh of the Huleh. The Circassians now dwelling here have but a bad repute. Fifty thousand of these turbulent and reckless people, who were engaged in the mas sacres of the Bulgarians, were deported to Syria at the close of the Russo-Turkish war (1878). The na tive Syrians look upon them with dread and speak of them as " bad men." Walking like moving arsenals, with sword, dagger, pistol and gun, and with cartridges ornamenting their breasts, they are a terror to these villagers, and add yet another to the discordant ele ments which make popular unity in Syria impossible. It would seem to be the policy of the Turkish govern ment to foster the enmities of race and creed which divide the people of Syria into hostile clans, so that they may not combine against her power.

An ambulam is a rude rest-house for native travellers, raised eight or ten feet on a foundation of masonry, so as to be above the miasma which always clings to the ground. However, I need not have digressed into the matter of rest-houses while speaking of Batnapura, where we were so speedily carried off to the charming home of a most kind family (Mrs. Atherton). A very pretty Singhalese prin cess, Kumarahanii Eckmalagoda, came with her father, Eckneligoda, to luncheon, and to invite us to their house for the evening festivities, namely, the Perehera, or proces sion iu honour of the August full moon. These continue every evening for a week. I have already described the festival as observed at Kandy,1 when the trea sures from all the temples are carried to the river, and at an auspicious moment the priests cut the water with golden swords, and rapidly empty and refill their temple water vessel at the very spot thus struck. At Batnapura the ceremony was very weird. First there was a rather pretty dance by a company of women. These were quickly succeeded by a very horrible apparition of men dressed to represent demons and wearing hideous masks suggestive of divers diseases. It is odd to see the conventional expression by which every variety of bodily ailment is depicted — fever by a red face, deafness by a vacant look, lameness or paralysis by twisted faces, idiotcy by distorted features, projecting eyes, and mouth drawn up. The masquers who thus personated the powers of evil each carried a three-pronged flaming torch, which they brandished while dancing a wild whirling dance, occasion ally refreshing the torches by throwing on them a resinous 1 See chapter x.

This South-Eastern Maritime Province, though only separated from the western coast by a mountain range not 5000 feet in height, is in every respect strangely diffe rent ; for whereas from April till July the west coast has a heavy rainfall, this too sheltered region can only hope for rain in November and December; so instead of rich luxuriant groves and large timber, the prevailing feature is dry thorny scrub, with here and there tracts of thirsty sand, only partially clothed with stunted grass and huge cactus-like euphorbias, with their odd four-sided stems and fleshy branches, growing to a height of over thirty feet. These scorched plains are subject to excessive drought, when rivers are. reduced to meagre streams meandering through an expanse of burning sand, and their tributaries wholly disappear, leaving only dry watercourses, tantalising to thirsty men and beasts. Then, when the rains do set in, they are apt to fall in such good earnest that the country is flooded, and when half dry, form deep unhealthy marshes, sending up a steaming miasma productive of fever, dysentery, the scourge of the country, and parangi, that dreadful and loathsome complaint said to be peculiar to Ceylon, and greatly due to lack of good food and good water. An immediate improvement in the condition of the district was looked for when, in 1876, the restoration of the great tank Tissamaharama, six or eight miles to the north of Magama, was completed ; but from various causes, chiefly from the scantiness of the population, who were

The inhabitants of South Brisbane suffer in the same way, and people point to marks made on their high door steps, to show how the water crept up to drench the parlour carpet, and to provide an unmanageable bath for the nursery. These piles, capped with plates to prevent white ants from getting to the wooden super-structures, give a very unsettled appearance to the place ; in other words, an air of pilgrimage. I may be reminded of Venice, but — well, there is a difference. There is flotsam and jetsam in the front gardens here instead of gondolas. It is a mystery to me that, built of wood as Brisbane chiefly is, those graceful forms of domestic architec ture are not used which have been adopted to some extent in Adelaide. Adelaide is a model of neatness and form. Brisbane happens to be neat here and there, and chances to run into good form ; but there has been little design in the running. It must be said, however, that the wise men of the northern colony seemed to be aware of their duty, and to have some regard for dignity in the architecture of public buildings. The Parliament buildings, if not imposing, have a fine upstanding appear ance, and are suggestive of what one finds everywhere in Queensland — boldness and breadth. They put to shame the miasma-making Parliament Houses of New South Wales ; they have light, air, colour, and some refinement in outline and structure. Perhaps some architects would say that they were built too bountifully ; but that is not out of harmony with Queensland. It is roomy, brawny, and big-shouldered. The new Treasury buildings are a step upwards from the Parliament build ings ; but that is to be expected ; the country is fifteen years older than it was when the places of legislation were erected. The Treasury buildings look out on

Bad whisky may kill her pioneers ; the Chinamen may take money out of the country ; the children may dwindle in the miasma of the far north, and mothers may grow wan and nerveless under the exhaust-pipes of a cruel atmosphere, but the march will not be stayed. The Queenslander will survive, and he will be robust in mind, as he will be warm in his physical vigour. The Irishman, the Scotsman, the Englishman, and the native, are distinct enough up here now, but one can see the fusion going on ; the levelling down and the levelling up ; the Irishman gaining directness and industrial confidence ; the Scotsman gathering adapta bility and warmth ; the Englishman leaving off his insularity ; and the native borrowing the good points of the others, and possessing also the feeling of certainty that, being of the soil, he can match them all, beat them at a bargain, and still be friends with them. One meets a good many English officers up north, — gentlefolk who have settled to the conditions of pioneering — and they show the constraining influence of the country in their habit, of speech and life. They move not neck and neck with, but in the track of the native ; and give as much as they get. They have investments in land and mines. They become planters ; they make a genteel yet frugal headway, and sometimes they do more. One finds fine young Englishmen — men whose family names are known in naval, military, and social circles in England — working away at the mines, on the railways, and on

There is no feeling more pleasant than to wake up in a new and beautiful place ; and that has been my experience several times on this journey. I awoke one morning, looked out of my porthole, saw mountains to the right of me, to the left of me, in front of me, the broad sea behind me, and a quiet town fringing the shore, per spiring already in the early sun, — and that was Cairns. I should not say that the town itself was beautiful, but it might be made so. I should not say that it has all the characteristics of a model municipality, but it has the latent qualifications to become that. It makes one shudder to see the hotels doing " a land office business " at eight o'clock in the morning ; to watch men staggering up the streets before the sun has drunk the miasma from " the rheumy and unpurged air." Cairns, I should think, has one hotel for every store and shop in the place, and it does not let them languish. Not that the town Is in the least rowdyish. I have seen no open rowdyism in any place in the North. It seems to be just a steady devotion to the hot and rebellious stuff that wastes no time in killing. All the liquor places in Cairns had an air of decency about them, but they were doing their work just the same, — doing it in a climate that in itself is devitalising and nerve-destroying. To understand what the climate is, just take a map and look where Sydney is, and think of its heat. Then move up the coast 1,500 miles, multiplying the heat as you go till after you come to Cairns. Look where the equator is, and think again. Think that in this winter time the thermometer is registering 900 in the shade at ten o'clock in the morning, and lOO0 at noon. Then picture to yourself hills above, the sea beyond, and corrugated iron and wood and dust about you, — and you are at

I chose the latter, for I should see plenty of sugar in my travels, and there is only one district like that of Stratford, where Mr. Behan has been the real pioneer in rice milling, if we except the Chinamen with their dollies. But why is it that in some of the streets of Cairns, and even in the principal street, one sees the grass growing, and gets the impression of a swift decay? Chiefly because the town is like Hilo in the Sandwich Islands, a place where it rains every morning. At Cairns it rains much for nine months in the year, and then it rains a little for three months, and begins again. Did that quiet fellow at Cairns tell the truth when he said that there are lily pools in parts of the main street for weeks at a time in the summer ? I do not know ; I only know that every body said that there were pools which held their own for months in that street of two chains in width, and lay there, the Dark One between them and the deep sea. I use the term " Dark One " designedly, for let us think how much that is demoniacal lies in those great pools. Can we wonder that doctors say no family will ever go to the third generation in Cairns ? The dread miasma will play its part till the great swamps are dried up, and the streets of the town are kept clear by drainage extra ordinary. But this might be said of all the places that I have visited. I thought Broken Hill was bad enough last year, but every town in northern Queensland can beat Broken Hill in the race of odours, hands down. Cairns looks longingly to the day, now very near, when vessels will come straight to her wharfs independent of tender or lighter ; and then, with her railway and a good steam communication, she will fight her fight bravely enough, one hopes.

Other consider ations, however, affected the administrators of the Com monwealth ; and it must be admitted that peace and quietness did not distinguish the Quakers during the Interregnum. They appeared then as levellers and blas phemers, as persistent brawlers in churches and contemners of authority, as confirmed opponents of whatever Govern ment might be in office, and as irreverent imitators of the most sacred incidents in Holy Writ. The Commonwealth, like every Government of whatever type, recognised only the hard flints and the pestilent miasma that lay upon the surface of the Quaker creed, leaving it for succeeding generations to exploit the soil, and to gather the priceless minerals that lay beneath. The Quakers, especially their women, were largely occupied with visions and dreams, and habitually enhanced the difficulties of their position by insisting upon narrating their visions, with comments of their own, to persons and bodies high in authority, who naturally resented this unwelcome interference. One of the first of these disturbers of the public peace was Hannah Thrapnell, the Prophetess of Whitehall, whose insistence upon interviewing Cromwell and the Council of State led to her being forcibly turned out of London and sent to her own country.1 She professed to have eaten and drunk nothing, but to have spent her time in songs and prayers, and yet when the order came for her removal she rose up and went away speedily and lustily for her home in the West. She was not long there, however, before she was brought before the justices at Truro as a vagrant, speaking openly against the Government, and was bound over to the assizes in sureties of £300 to take her trial 1 Mercurius Politicus, April, 1654.

By Jove ! when you fellows at home are blessing the sun, we are cursing it." Aster which epigram he tapped his second egg, and I let him off any further questioning. A steady jog on the elephant soon brought us to the head of a ravine which Buddoo had arranged to beat for us. We took up our positions on opposite sides of the somewhat precipitous entrance, and the beat commenced nearly a mile away. As the noise of the yelling villagers, who vigorously thrashed the jungle with their long sticks and uttered the most fiendish cries as they advanced, came nearer, we were keenly on the alert to shoot any thing that turned up. Two small deer made their appear ance, and we missed them both. A pig dashed through, and the Engineer hit him hard to all appearance, but piggy dashed on and was lost in a neighbouring paddy field. Then came a fine-looking black-buck whom I managed to stop, but for two or three minutes there was a cessation of anything in the shape of big game. At last, when the circle of beaters was drawing very close, there was a huge crashing among the bushes and a large, dark body loomed through the branches. I was about to cover him with a very steady aim, when the other man shouted, with something of a laugh in his voice, " Don't shoot." A second later there blundered into full view a big buffalo, who had strayed from the neigh bouring village and was startled out of a comfortable 1;

The corpses of those who are not worth burn ing are thrown in the same rivers, and their number is great, because it includes all Shudras, pariahs, and various other outcasts, as well as Brahman children under three years of age. /. Only rich and high-born people are buried pompously. It is for them that the sandal-wood fires are lit after sun set; it is for them that mantrams are chanted, and for them that the gods are invoked. But Shudras must not listen on any account to the divine words dictated at the beginning of the world by the four Rishis to Yeda- Vyasa, the great theologian of Aryavarta. No fires for them, no prayers. As during his life a Shudra never approaches a temple nearer than seven steps, so even after death he cannot be put on the same level with the "twice-born." Brightly burn the fires, extending like a fiery serpent along the river. The dark outlines of strange, wildly fantastical figures silently move amongst the flames. Sometimes they raise their arms towards the sky, as if in a prayer, sometimes they add fuel to the fires and poke them with long iron pitchforks. The dying flames rise high, creeping and dancing, sputtering with melted human fat and shooting towards the sky whole showers of golden sparks, which are instantly lost in the clouds of black smoke. This on the right side of the river. Let us now see what is going on on the left.

Here superstition is the exception, at all events amongst true Protestants, and lingers only in rare tales of folk-lore. But throughout the East it clings like a foul and deadly miasma to the spiritual, moral, and intellectual ignorance of the still practically pagan Bible lands. This superstition takes countless forms, and is especially fostered by the women, owing to their being kept in a state of abject ignorance. Well has the able Eastern writer, Butras Bistany, said : " How few of the hundreds of thousands of women in Syria know how to read ! . . . How many abomi nable superstitions do they follow. . . .

Large tracts were left altogether without cultivation, a prey to barren ness and miasma. Even Cicero's letters are filled with com plaints respecting the solitude of vast districts, the insalu brity of once healthy localities, the properties of doubtful title altogether abandoned. Strabo informs us that in Samnium, once the most flourishing part of the whole Peninsula, but two towns remained. " The plains once tilled by the sturdy Sabine," says Pliny, "have been de livered over to the branded faces, the fettered feet, and manacled hands of slaves." The lands, where cultivated at all, had fallen into the hands of great proprietors, who indulged their extravagant taste by covering whole districts with piles of building and wildernesses of pleasure-ground. Outside these fantastic realms roamed the wild shepherd of the Apennines, the hunted runaway, and the outlaw, veri table progenitors of the brigand of the Abruzzi. Within toiled the slave, under the superintendence of other slaves, accountable in their turn to the villicus, or bailiff, himself also a slave. " The agriculturists, as well what were called freedmen as slaves, were almost all barbarians by birth, without any interest in a social order, which only oppressed them, without courage for its defence, and without any pecuniary resources for themselves."* No free man wielded mattock or spade, or sped the plough. The employment of Cincinnatus, the employment lauded by Cicero as the most gentlemanly, the most honourable, the most worthy of human arts, would have been held to degrade the insolent hands of those who bore the dishonoured name of Roman citizens. What was the result 1 There could be but one. " A bold peasantry, their country's pride, When once destroy'd, can never be supplied."

Night though closes quickly in, and if we would see the Annamite suburbs we must give rein to our impatient little black steeds and bowl swiftly out into the country, by some fields of brilliant pale green rice, where the monster grey water buffaloes, with branching horns laid backwards, strong and patient, are being driven home from working in them, by coolies, hidden under bamboo hats the size of umbrellas. The marshes have been in a measure drained, but the miasma rises thickly from the rice fields, near which cluster the wretched huts of thatched bamboo.

Then we reach the military boun dary, and returning homewards another way, pass the cemetery where many a Frenchman lies low. Along these shady avenues, deep and cool, we see the walled compounds and overgrown gardens of the'bungalows of officers and merchants, of whom about 1700 reside in Saigon.

In the coldest months of the year there are frequent spells of damp, sultry weather, in which everything sweats, and all the delectable smells of the city and camp creep out and revel. Prolonged droughts, suddenly followed by storms of the most terrific description, make agricultural and pastoral industry in the south extremely pre carious. A seca sometimes lasts for months at a stretch, during which time the blazing sun — from which, for hundreds of leagues in the camp, there is no shelter — burns up every vestige of verdure ; the ground is parched, and cracks up into great fissures ; cattle, sheep, and horses perish by hundreds, as much from starvation as from want of water ; the camp is strewn with whitened bones, the air is loaded with pestilential vapours from putrefying carcases, and miasma from stagnant pools and half dried pantanos ; and the apparently limitless plain resembles a prairie after a fire. Long droughts are always followed by violent storms and heavy rainfalls of uncertain duration, but sometimes lasting for many weeks. The rivers of the south — the Salado, Rio Negro, Ouequen, etc. — overflow their banks, and in an incredibly short space of time what was a burning desert becomes an angry sea. Bridges, railway-banks, cattle, horses, sheep, men, everything that impedes its force is swept away. Storms like these are usually preceded by a pampero.

There are many ways of rig ging up the netting, but the simplest of all is to take a piece of strong calico, say blue " pentado," seven feet long and three feet wide; around the edges of this sew a length of netting five feet wide ; to each corner stitch a piece of strong tape, and the arrangement is complete. After the ground-sheet, mattress, and blank ets are spread for the night, get four of your carriers' spears, and stick one into the ground at each corner, from which, by means of the tapes, suspend the net at a convenient height. After getting into bed, tuck the edge of the netting in under the mattress all around. But whatever shape you may adopt for your mosquito netting, remember that it is positively indispensable. A rubber ground-sheet is essential in case you re quire to sleep in the open ; but this is the only article of rubber goods one need take, as air-pillows and such like give way in a few months.

Of course the number of those who had become " seasoned " (as they called it) or acclimated was constantly increasing. And although for manifest reasons this class contended " that no place hath a more pleasant ayre then Virginia," the fact was, as Hagthorpe replied, " And so may that same ayre seem fresh to the senses wherein we draw the pesti lence," etc. In order to do justice to our founders we must look at the real difficulties just as these then confronted them in England, en route, and in Virginia, in Spain, in France, etc. They cannot be fairly judged on partial accounts, or mere personal and partisan criticisms, whatever the motive. The difficulty in Virginia was not the climate only. The wary, cunning savages were there within their native wilds and woods. They were apt to pretend an especial friendship when plotting an especial mischief, and no one at all famil iar with the Indian character can read the numerous con temporary accounts without being convinced that they were really the enemies of the English from the first — continu ing to hamper them in almost every way, and to kill them at every favorable opportunity. To contend against a peo ple who have always lived in savage freedom, and who enjoy strength and vigor amid the deadly miasma which killed the English like a shot, was not mere child's play. The difficulties which had to be met and overcome in Europe, in America, and at sea, cannot be overestimated ; and those who devoted their lives to meeting these diffi culties, until the task was accomplished, cannot be honored too much by their posterity.

But this soil, which might vie with the whole world in its yield of dried fruits, is allowed to breed only miasma and death. The power to initiate or originate is not largely developed, and yet they possess much native cun ning. Their skill in adulteration is well known ; it is possible that their forefathers acquired the art from Europeans, but certainly the pupil has learnt to excel the master. In all business transactions with Europeans the negro is generally competent to take care of himself. The power to imitate is most marvellous. A goldsmith will make an exact copy of an elaborately designed piece of European jewellery. Work in leather, wood, stone, iron, copper and silver is astonishing to those who expect to find in the native only uncouth savagery. But

Outside Colombo is a flat marshy district over which the miasma mists hang night and morning, but at noontide how enticingly lovely they look ! Nature, like vice, can paint her foulest spots with the most alluring beauty — for mile after mile great expanses of marshy land, festooned with the fairest flowers that bloom, relieved with stately palms and beset with tangled masses of exhaustless shrubbery. It is said that the building of the railway through the low-lying swamps cost a human Use a mile from malarial fever. In twenty miles the rise is not more than two feet, then the ascent begins, and a panoramic series of magnificent views takes place. At Sensation Point we wound around an unprotected ledge of rock, and, looking down beloAv, saw a sheer perpen dicular descent of fifteen hundred feet right to a sparkling, splashing river, rapidly running its devious course. Kandy was soon reached, and the only draAvbacks ex perienced there were the all-pervading smell and taste of cocoa-nut oil, and the terrible mosquitoes. The author of Picturesque Ceylon commences the chapter on Kandy something in this fashion : " My pen has now the difficult task to perform of describing the most beautiful spot in

But now they found the founda tions of the rocks beneath breaking up ; that withering, incessant shower of ashes and scoriæ destroyed all their crops ; the mild and delicate air changed into a heavy, sulphurous miasma ; while overhead the beneficent face of the bright-blue sky had become a horrible canopy of deadly black, about which played lurid coruscations of infernal fires. What they endured throughout those days and nights of woe, could never be told. They fled from the home they had reared with such abundance of loving labour, taking refuge in a cave ; for not even the knowledge that the mountain itself seemed to be in the throes of dis solution could entirely destroy their trust in those apparently eternal fastnesses.

Although the tide no longer ebbed and flowed among the reeds and islets of the marsh, yet it was covered with small ponds, some of them stagnant, others formed by the many streams which flowed towards the culverts on the Embankment, through which at low tide they escaped into the Thames ; until some kind of drainage was attempted, the place caused agues and fevers for any who slept in its white miasma. In other words, not an embank ment only, but drainage of some kind, had to be undertaken before life was possible on the marsh. (3) There were no quays, no shipping, no merchants, no trade, on the south side. All merchandise coming up from the south for export at the port of London, all merchandise landed at the port for the south, had to be carried across the Bridge. (4) The crowds of people connected with the trade of London — the porters, carriers, drivers, grooms and stable boys, stevedores, lightermen, sailors foreign and native, the employes of the merchants, their wives, women and children — ■ all these people lived in London itself; they had their taverns and drinking shops ; their sleeping places and eating places, in London ; all the people employed in providing food and drink and sport, lived on the other side. South London had to be a place without trade, without noise, without disturbance of workmen, without broils among the sailors or fights among foreigners. (5) It stood on the south bank of a river swarming with fish. (6) The only parts on which houses could be built were along the line of the causeways, or along the line of the Em bankment. These were the conditions. We should expect, therefore, to find the place thinly inhabited ; and to find that the houses were all built beside or along the raised ways. We should

Theirs were the principal seats upon the Lempantam or high stone platform in the Nach or Council Lodge — theirs, next to the king's, the best portion of cooked food and kava upon the days of solemn festival. Throughout all the tribes great respect was paid to the chiefs, who were never addressed as " thou" but always in the second person plural "ye." As in Malaysia there were many special words used in addressing a chief, and again there was another set form of words for addressing the king, who was looked up to with great awe, and only addressed in the plural of majesty as " They." The chiefs mingle amongst their tribesmen with great famili arity and affability, which, no doubt, forms a fresh bond of sympathy and union. They all hold together loyally ; offend one, and all are eager to take up his quarrel. If the chief be a kindly hospitable man, his people will follow his example. If he be a rogue and a churl, his people will act as rogues and churls too. And this I have observed is a characteristic of Caroline islanders in general. They seem to have little independence of judgment, and love to follow the lead of their chiefs in all things crooked or straight, right or wrong. (B) NAMES OF NATIVE DISEASES The miasmas arising from the swampy belt of alluvium surrounding Ponape give rise to various catarrhal and febrile maladies, very fatal to the old people during the rainy season, with its flight and variable winds. An important factor in the health of the people is the trade wind that blows clear and fresh out of the north-east from October to May. Their names for fever are : Cho-mau pou and Chomau-karrakar, the first denoting the cold, the second the hot fit of the malady. They call the smallpox, introduced by a whaling vessel some forty years ago, and which carried off half the population of the island, Kilitap or Peeling Skin.

" Fevers, although frequent at Ibo during the rainy season, are rarely dangerous, except when the patients commit imprudences, or fail to have medical assistance. " On the mainland the climatic conditions are still better, because the islands are generally low and more or less surrounded by mangoes, whereas the continent is always more or less hilly, with great abundance of good drinking Avater, good and various foods, with feAv places where miasma develops." Ancl Lieutenant Jos. Coutinho says : — " Even on the coast, and close to the Rovuma, fevers are rarely fatal. If the European leaves low grounds and goes up the hills and plateaux of the interior, he will soon be cured of any fever he may have caught." Writing from Mualia (about a hundred miles inland from Pemba Bay), Mr. Furman says :— " During eight months of the year the evenings, nights ancl mornings, are cool and delightful, the temperature varying from 65° to 70° F., ancl during the warmest portion of the days, 11.30 a.m. to 3p.m., varying from 80° to 85°, ancl occasionally 90° in the

Very soon after there was a serious epidemic of small pox, and all those who had been vaccinated escaped. Thus in Tangier, considering that it is an eastern town, vaccination is extensively used, but small-pox, both in Morocco and Spain, is common, so people will be wise who are vaccinated before they leave England for a tour in these countries. There is a good deal of miasma about Tangier, and it is unwise to linger near stagnant water. It is unsafe to drink the water anywhere in Morocco. While listening to stories of Moorish oppression and cruelty, and hearing of the uncivilized way in which the people live, it is hard to realize that one is but two or three hours' steam from a British port. All visitors to Tangier are familiar with the outward aspect of the prison there, that dark and noisome living tomb, with its tiny window, through which eager hands are stretched for the food brought by friends, the only food the prisoners get. But I daresay many persons do not know why most of these poor creatures are shut up, though it is an open enough secret in the place, for a Moor, if he has money, will do everything in his power to conceal the fact, lest he be seized, locked up, and probably tortured till all of it is handed over ; and then perhaps he is forgotten and ends his life, which cannot be a long one, never regaining his liberty. Many of these wretched beings, when in terror of the authorities, entreat the representa tives of our government to protect them, and occasionally the British Consul will find that during the night a sheep has been sacrificed on his immaculately white door-steps, a tribute which a Moor believes no one could resist. But what, except in a very small way, can be done when the Emperor of Morocco has abso lute power and his system of government is corrupt to the core?

The final struggle on the hills east of the city might then have had a very different termination. The policy that General Linares should have adopted was the Fabian policy of obstruction, harassment, and delay. Every hour that he could detain General Shatter's advan cing army on the Siboney road increased his own chances of success and lessened those of his adversary; because the army of defense, already acclimated, could stand exposure to sun, rain, and miasma much better than the army of invasion could. Besides that, a column of five thousand regulars from Manzanillo was hurrying to his assistance, and it was of the utmost importance that these reinforcements should reach him before he should be forced into a decisive battle. Instead of resisting General Shaffer's advance, however, with obstinate pertinacity on the Siboney road, he abandoned his strong position at Guasimas, after a single sharp but inconclusive engagement, and retreated almost to Santiago without striking another blow. As I have already said with regard to the unopposed landing at Daiquiri and Siboney, it was great luck for General Shafter, but it was not war. We passed the battle-field of Guasimas about noon, with out stopping to examine it, and pushed on toward Sevilla with a straggling, disorderly column of soldiers belonging to the Second and Twenty-first Infantry, who were following a battery of light artillery to the front.

The Brahmin inhabitants of these parts are forbidden a like indulgence under the penalty of exclusion from caste. But they supply the defect by opium, the use of which, although universally interdicted elsewhere, is nevertheless considered much less objectionable than the use of intoxicating liquors. The people of these damp and unhealthy districts have no doubt learnt by experience that a moderate use of spirits or opium is necessary for the preservation of health, and that it protects them, partially at any rate, against the ill effects of the malarious miasma amidst which they are obliged to live. Nothing indeed but absolute necessity could have induced them to contravene in this way one of the most venerable precepts of Hindu civilization. The various classes of Sudras who dwell in the hills of the Carnatic observe amongst their domestic regulations a practice as peculiar as it is disgusting. Both men and women pass their lives in a state of uncleanness and never wash their clothes. When once they have put on cloths fresh from the looms of the weavers they do not leave them off until the material actually drops from rottenness. One can imagine the filthy condition of these cloths after they have been worn day and night for several months soaked with perspiration and soiled with dirt, especially in the case of the women, who continually use them for wiping their hands, and who never change their garments until wear and tear have rendered them absolutely useless. Yet this revolting habit is most religiously observed, and, if anybody were so rash as to wash but once in water the cloths with which he or she is covered, exclusion from caste would be the inevitable consequence. This custom, however, may be due to the scarcity of water, for in this part of the country there are only a few stagnant ponds, which would very soon be contaminated if all the inhabitants of a village were allowed to wash their garments in them. Many religious customs are followed only by certain sects, and are of purely local character. For instance, it is only in the districts of Western Mysore that I have observed Monday in each week kept nearly in the same way as Sunday is

Though they were burned black by the sun, and covered with mud, as I crawled in and out among them along the narrow trench I could not but see that the faces of the majority of the men were yellow or pale. They were all evidently worn out, and some quite dead beat with fatigue. I saw not a few in the very act of falling asleep as I passed, exhausted nature suc cumbing to overpowering fatigue. Some were trembling like aspen leaves with the first chill of the fever upon them, and others were nauseated and giddy with the miasmas and the strange earthy smell which arose from the freshly dug trenches. Still it was plain to see — and a proud sight it was — that, however much they suffered, however terribly they were reduced, there was not a single man in the long trench line who had the slightest thought of giving in, of whom it might be feared that at the critical moment he would fail in the performance of his duty. There was not a man in the whole line who looked the picture of health and strength they had all been when they left Tampa; but there was not one man of the thousands there who would have changed his position for any other post of less danger and more comfort. Soldiers rarely talk of the thing that lies before them, but they one and all regarded the fact that they were on the firing-line, and bearing the brunt of the fight, as such a lucky and kindly disposition of Providence toward each and every one of them personally, that every now and then I heard them bursting out into exclamations of thanksgiving at their good fortune, and of sympathy for those whose duties were equally arduous, but not so interesting or perhaps so impor-

It was decided that late on the afternoon of the 15th the newly placed batteries should drop a few scattering shots in and about these trenches, only sufficient to get the range and without betraying the number of our guns, and then upon the morning of the 16th, at or before dawn, we were to open fire with all guns upon the little huts in which the Spaniards passed the night. For them, indeed, it promised to be a rude awakening. It was hoped that our fire would prove too strong to permit of their regaining their positions in the trenches — that they would retreat into the town, and that our assaulting parties would only have to contend with the detachments that had remained on guard in the trenches. The first gun from General Randolph's batteries was to have been the signal for McKibbin's men, under the shadow of San Pablo, and for Ludlow's men, down at Dos Caminos, to leave their trenches and charge across the intervening ground through the leaden hail. It was understood that the brigadier who first made a lodgment within the Spanish line was to get another star; and, indeed, it did not require this incentive for the men of the two brigades to prepare for the struggle, and to strain every nerve to come well out of it. McKibbin's men had the shortest line to run, barely four hundred yards, while Ludlow had at least six hundred; but in his front the Spaniards were neither so numerous nor so strongly in trenched. All through the night of the 14th and the 15th the men were engaged in sending challenges and bets from

We are constantly reminded that " Mr. Kriiger is such a very religious man " ; that the Boers of the Transvaal "are such a religious people;" that " every day and always they read their Bibles," and so on. There is religion and religion ! The American negro has a religion which permits him to sing many warm hymns and at the same time " to rob the henroosts." Grave inconsistencies are certainly human. It is not necessary in the case of Transvaal Boers and their Government to put to the credit of hypocrisy what is probably — at least in some cases — rightly to be attributed to fanaticism and a low state of civilisation. Bible reading, especially the study of the Old Testament, is unfortunately not inconsistent with selfishness, narrowness, coarseness, immorality, and the love of money. A divorce between religion and morality is the gravest disaster ; and if religion in South Africa is, as it unfortunately is, marked at the present time by a widespread indifferentism, a good deal of this may be laid to the door of a corrupt Oligarchy using and encouraging methods quite incon sistent with integrity, while encouraging a narrow fanaticism and carrying on its lips the sacred words of Scripture. Corruption soon runs down from the head to the members. A corrupt Government tends to spread corruption through the whole body politic. Men cannot always breathe miasma without suffering from infection in the blood. We expect to find when such a state of things exists in high quarters looseness of moral principle gradually affecting the atmosphere of social life, and we do find it. Can men be so bitterly

Slowly and surely the lines drew up around the city. The Spanish gar rison numbered some thirteen thousand men, amply supplied with ammunition, behind trenches and barbed wire fences which were so well arranged as to excite the admiration of our engineers. The country around was filled with Spanish soldiers. Everyone knew that the heaviest work was yet to be done. The American troops, however, had a more dreaded enemy than the Spaniards. The intolerable heat, the soaking rains, the piercing night chills, the lack of proper food, and, above all, the miasma of the ground were daily preying upon the vitality of the sol diers who had come so robust and hardy from their American camps. It was feared that an epidemic of yellow fever or typhoid fever was at hand. It certainly was. What was to be done must evidently be done quickly. Moreover, the whole army had a natural ambition to see the Stars and Stripes floating over Santiago by the Fourth of July. Around and above Santiago was an open plateau. Here the dense and tangled thickets and the mountain trails ended. The problem before General Shafter was to close around Santiago and capture it before General Linares with his thirteen thousand soldiers could escape, and before General Pando, marching from the north, could throw in his reinforcement of eight thousand men.

In consequence of acting upon this theory, I took no precautionary measures, and exposed myself needlessly to the miasma of the swamps. The inevita ble consequences were visited upon me. No sooner had we weighed anchor, than I found myself stricken with fever, and I lay in a miserable state for some days. Thanks to the kind and excellent attention of Dr. White, head surgeon of the Pensacola, who dosed me with copious, if not agreeable, draughts of War burg's Tincture, my illness proved of short duration. And then another form of African fever attacked me. It was an irresistible longing to penetrate the Dark Continent for purposes of exploration, and of observ ing both man and nature. As I sat upon the deck, viewing the panoramic receding of the sandy shores of Damara Land, the melancholy which usually comes over a convalescent fever patient seemed actually to fan into burning my desire to see what lay beyond the sand-dunes of the coast. Little did I dream, how ever, that seven long years would be spent amid the thrilling scenes and episodes of the early settlement of a vast country which lay a thousand miles to the east of those sand-dunes. Although much literature concerning South Africa has appeared during the last few years, doubtless there are many Americans who still entertain vague ideas as to the state of civilization at the Cape of Good Hope. Regarding Africa generally, we usually think of it as a wild, half-explored country ; but whoever applies that idea to Cape Town would be surprised, as I was, upon landing there to find it a place where it takes but little imagination to think one's self in one's own country.

DISEASES. that the climate of Australia was prejudicial to the human constitution; but it is, in reality, highly favorable, for the reason, probably, that as the vegetation is so scanty, the at mosphere is but little tainted by the miasma formed by its decomposition. Deaths from disease are very rare ; and all disorders, even the worst cases of syphilis, soon yield to the simplest remedies. Endemic diseases are not at all common ; and small-pox, measles, and hooping-cough, are almost un known. Dysentery is the most prevalent complaint. Chil dren suffer considerably from the presence of the teres, or round worm. Ophthalmia is often produced at the south by the hot dusty winds from the interior. It may be said to be unhealthy within the tropics, but it is certainly less so than in other countries lying in the same latitude. Typhus and acute fevers prevail there during the wet monsoons ; and in the sea son of the variable winds, pectolapia, or moon-blindness, su persedes ophthalmia. Scurvy also appears to be endemic on the northern coast, and manifests itself with peculiar viru lence where the tropical heat is exercised full upon the damp soil. But even in these warm latitudes, though disease is far from being a stranger, it generally puts on a mild form, and is easily subdued. (4.) Peculiar as are the geology and climate of Australia, it might be expected that the vegetable creation would pre sent appearances equally wonderful. Nature seems here to have escaped from her leading strings, and displayed the pow ers of a giant. Discarding the customary shapes in which she appears in the old world, she develops herself in new and unwonted forms. The humble grasses that carpet our plains and valleys, here collect in tall clumps and tussocks, as if too proud to spread themselves over the earth, for man or beast to tread upon with impunity ; and the pretty honeysuckle that shelters or conceals the prairie home of the American set tler, or twines its graceful tendrils around the porch of the peasant's cottage in merry England, rears itself in stately majesty among the other denizens of the Australian forests, and disdains either to give protection, or to ask it in return.

It was accounted the most beautiful stream of Greece, and was farther celebrated, as Pausanias affirms, from the adventure of Daphne and Apollo.

Camion and Gathcates, two small streams more to the west, the latter of which rose near the village of Gathcæ. 4. Acheron and Dalian, flow ing into the Alpheus near Typdna in Elis. The Acheron was probably so called from the peculiar veneration with which Ceres, Proserpina, and Pluto were wor shipped on its banks. The more celebrated Acheron was in Thesprotia, in Epirus ; and there was also a third river of the name in Bruttium, in Italy. 11. Anigrus, rising in a mountain of Arcadia called Lapitha, and after flowing through Elis, falling into the Sinus Cyparis sius, or Gulf of Arcadia. It formed marshes at its mouth from the want of a fall to carry off the water fully. This stagnant pool exhaled an odor so fetid as to be perceptible at the dis tance of twenty stadia, and the fish caught there were so tainted with the infection that they could not be eaten. Pausanias, however, affirms that this miasma was not confined to the marshes, but could be traced to the very source of the river. It was ascribed to the centaurs having washed the wounds in flicted by Hercules's envenomed shafts in this stream. The Anigrus received the waters of a fountain said to possess the property of curing cutaneous disorders. This source issued from a cavern sacred to the nymphs called Anigriades. Leake

They help to purify it by removing miasma and exhalations locally injurious, but ad mitting of such dilution as to be ultimately harmless : — they favour and assist in the fecundation of plants by the distribution of pollen : — they modify and equalize the temperature of various parts of the surface : — they convey clouds, and thus distribute moisture, and render the interior of continents fertile ; but sometimes they carry with them poison and death, for they bear along the insects and the blight that often destroy the hopes of the husbandman, and the fever that baffles the skill of the physician. 98. Generally if two districts are unequally heated a cold wind will set in near the surface from the less heated to the more heated district, while a corresponding current in the opposite direction takes place in the upper regions of the atmosphere. Thus, when the sun shines during the day, and land and water are equally exposed to its influence, the land is more heated than the water, and a cool breeze is soon felt setting in landwards ; while in the evening when the sun has set, and the greater radiation cools the earth sooner than the water, the converse takes place, and in this way is readily explained the phenomena of land and sea breezes, and the numerous apparent anomalies observed in local prevalent winds. 99. The trade-winds are likewise periodical winds, occurring near the tropics in the open ocean. The portion of the earth near the equator is the hottest part of the globe, and the air over it is there fore more heated than elsewhere, while on the other hand the regions near the poles are exposed to perpetual cold. There is thus induced a constant cool current near the earth, setting south wards from the north pole, and northwards from the south pole, and constant warm currents above this cooler one, proceeding from the equator towards each pole. These would be distinctly observ able everywhere, but for the revolution of the earth round its axis from west to east, which alters such currents, and produces a tendency to north-east winds in the northern, and south-east in the southern hemisphere. But now comes into play another result of the condition of the atmosphere, for the wind advancing along the surface from the poles northwards or southwards, must, as it approaches nearer the equator, arrive successively at points which

Since the opening of the eastern and other roads, Kurunaigalla has rapidly increased in population and importance, and many native dealers from the coast have migrated thither. The bazaar is now well supplied, and is the centre to which the inhabitants of the whole country round bring their produce to barter for the salt, salt fish, and manufactures imported from the coast. The country in the vicinity is extremely fertile and beautiful, and part of it is irrigated by a large tank, the outlet of which, unlike those of Kandelle and Mennairia, is formed in a natural manner by its embankment joining a low rocky ______ The rocky precipices, magnificent trees, and beautiful patches of bright green meadow, diversified with the profusion of jungle foliage, and the miniature and well wooded islets, contribute to produce a scene of mingled sublimity and beauty. In the vicinity of Kurunai galla are sculptures of elephants, lions, and an animal resembling the unicorn. Kurunaigalla, though the head-quarters of the revenue, and judicial officers of the Government, and a military station, is much infested by elephants, who, regardless of its rising population, con tinue to make it their house of call in passing into the low country, and vice versd. Kurunaigalla1 is the chief station of the Seven Korles, and the residence of an assistant Government agent. That district is very extensive, containing the larger portion of the Western Province within its limits, and is separated from the Harisiapattoo, in the cen tral province, by the Dik-oya ; on the south by the Maha-oya, which separates it from the Three Korles and Four Korles ; on the west by the districts of Chilaw and Putlam, and the Demelepattoo, and on the north by the Kalawa-oya, which separates it from Nuwera Kalawa. It was formerly divided into seven korles (the seat of a dissavony), and subdivided into twenty -four pattoos, called respectively the Eihala-dolos pattoo, or upper twelve pattoos, and the Palaha-dolos pattoo, or lower twelve pattoos. The face of the country in the former por tion is diversified with mountains and huge abrupt rocks ; the latter is in general flat. The climate hi most parts is far from healthy, and endemic fever prevails in some parts, at certain seasons, which is to be attributed to the influence of miasma, arising from swamps and marshes. Kurunaigalla, from being situated to the westward of the mountains in the vicinity, is sheltered from the disagreeable in fluences of the land wind, while it has all the benefits of the sea breeze. The soil is for the most part fertile, yielding paddy, fine grain, cotton and hemp, as also cocoa-nuts, jack-fruits, hmes, and even cinnamon in small quantities, which are exchanged for the manufactures or produce of the coast. From Kurunaigalla to Anuradhapoora, the route lays nearly north, 1 This place was attacked by the insurgents in the recent emeute, but they were driven from it, after having done some injury to the pubhc buildings.

In 1817, while there was yet a strong opposition to the Erie Canal, and its friends were in the greatest anxiety, and even doubt as to the final result, Judge Forman furnished a series of articles, which were published in the Onondaga Register, signed X, in defense of the work. These papers were writ ten with great ability, and are said by competent judges, to be inferior to none that had been written upon that subject. In 1821, Judge Forman obtained the passage of a law, (drawn by his own hand,) authorizing the lowering of Onon daga Lake, and subsequently the lake was lowered about two feet. The great difficulty had been caused by the high water in the Seneca River, rising to a certain height, which obstructed the channel of the Onondaga outlet ; and such was the nature of the obstructions, arising from the narrow ness and crookedness of the passage, that when the Seneca River subsided to its proper limits, the water of Onondaga Lake was retained, and in rainy seasons did not fall so as to make dry ground around it, till late in summer, which was the cause of much inconvenience to the people living in the vi cinity of the lake. To obviate this, the lake was lowered, and by it the lands around Salina and Syracuse were im proved, leaving bare a beach about the lake, in some places of several rods in width. For the cause of philanthropy and humanity, this was a most important measure. The country around became more healthful, and although previously in fested with a fatal miasma in August and September, from that time to this, the country about Syracuse and Salina, has been considered as healthy as any other section in the State. In 1822, Judge Forman procured the passage of a law authorizing the erection of fixtures for the purpose of manu facturing coarse salt by solar evaporation, with a three cent per bushel bounty on salt so manufactured, for a given num ber of years. He went to New Bedford, in company with Isaiah Townsend, Esq., to make inquiries relative to solar evap oration of salt water, from persons interested in this mode of

For full information respecting every question connected with the river in modern days, the reader may be referred to the Official Reports on the Indus, &c., &c., by Lieutenants Wood and Carless, of the Indian Navy, published by Captain Postans in his work on Sindh. (13.) Anciently there were eleven large mouths to the Indus ; three of them now suffice to discharge its waters in the dry season. The navigable course of the Indus is usually estimated at 900 miles. Its average breadth below Hyderabad is about three-quarters of a mile j higher up and lower down it is much wider. The maximum strength of the current is seven and one-sixteenth geographical miles an hour : the height of the inundation varies from thirteen to sixteen feet. (14.) " Dandh," or " Kolab," is a tract of low land flooded by the inun dation, partially or totally dry during the cold season, and at all times a hot-bed of miasma. (15.) The Hindoos of Sindh have a tradition that Hiranyakasipu, the demon king of Multan, was powerful enough to draw down Megha Rasa, the Cloud-god, from heaven, and compel him to promise never to visit the Valley of the Indus. Besides the preternatural, there is an obvi ous natural cause for the almost total absence of rain in the want of trees, the destruction of which is one of the excesses to which the rancour of Asiatic warfare leads. (16.) Captain James M'Murdo, a great authority in the historical, and all other subjects connected with our province, opines that the libraries and records of the old Mohammedan families of Bukkur and other cities, would, if laid open to us, considerably increase our stock of knowledge regarding ancient Sindh. I utterly failed to discover any of these trea sures ; the only Arabic chronicles shown to me, were recent translations of modern histories, probably from the Persian ; and the value attached to them by their ignorant possessors was almost incredible. (17.) As General Briggs, the learned translator of Ferishtah remarks, these books are not easily procurable. I doubt, however, whether, if pro cured, they or any other Moslem work would, as he thinks, throw light on the intercourse said to prevail between India and Egypt previous to Mo hammedanism. (18.)

To the principal members of the Board was confided the care of studying all these projects in detail. The Board assumed, as the basis of the system proposed, that, in a free country, constituted like the United States, the national defence ought to rest on a foundation supported by the navy, by fortifications, by means of communication by land and water, and by a regular army and an organized militia. That, after the navy, the militia should be called on for active co-operation ; that, to render their co-operation effective, fortifi cations were required, as well for a place of shelter as for the means of checking the invasion of an enemy. That all the points on the coast not being equally vulnerable or important, permanent defences ought to be commenced at points presenting at the same time the greatest inducements to an enemy, and the most important positions for the navy, as har bors of safety and rendezvous: The Board also unanimously recognized the necessity of first employing the resources of the State to protect the coast by forti fications on the Gulf of Mexico, and especially on the delta of the Mississippi. With the object, therefore, of drawing up plans for this frontier, General Bernard commenced his honorable mission. Heedless of exposure to the dangerous climate of Louisiana, and the sickly miasma of the Mississippi marshes, he repaired thither immedi ately on his arrival in the United States, and there remained two years, the better to perform his duties. The sense of duty in him assumed almost a religious character. In the conception of the various projects concerning this im mense system of defence and commercial communication, Gene ral Bernard had a splendid opportunity of developing his rare talents, and his deep and varied information as an engineer. He sought to direct his European military mind to democratic institu tions, to the commercial habits of the nation which did him the honor to call him into its service, so as personally to contribute to one of the most gigantic works that had ever been conceived or executed. He traced all the roads, canals, and means of communication which were to bind together every part of the Union. He pro jected the greater number of those fortresses which will place a

But a great object of interest here is the remains of the Cloaca Maxima, or the great sewer of Rome, which came down from the Roman Forum, conducting off through this immense artery all the filth of the ancient city, and emptying it but a little distance from this into the Tiber. The masonry by which this sewer is constructed is gigantic, and must endure while the world standeth. Many ofthe branches of the Cloaca Maxima are choked up, and are supposed now, by breeding miasma, to produce pestilence. Now, facing the north, we may take a sweep round the west side of the Capi toline Hill, and pass in the way some splendid ruins, of which the theatre of Marcellus is the most magnificent ; and we again ascend the mount by a flight of steps in front of the modern Capitol, which is the opposite side ofthe Forum. This flight of steps was planned by Michael Angelo under Pope Paul III. On the tops are two antique colossal statues of Castor and Pollux, with their horses, together with a number of beautiful ancient trophies, and two an cient mile-stones, one of which, marked I, was the first stone on the ancient Appian Way ; and in the square above is a splendid equestrian statue of bronze of Marcus Aurelius. This is said to be the only ancient bronze equestrian statue now known to be in existence. Passing by this and to the south of the Capitol, you may call at the left at a little church called the Church of St. Jo seph, under which is the ancient state prison of Rome, called the Mamertine Prison. This prison is of an early date, and consists of two stories ; the lower, supposed to have been built by Servius Tullius, is the one in which Jugurtha was starved to death, and where St. Peter and St. Paul wrere imprisoned. As we went down the staircase to these prisons, our attention was called to an indent ation in one of the massy stones that compose the walls, about the size of a man's head, and one or two inches deep, screened by an iron grating. This was produced by St. Peter's head. When he was going into the prison, the jailer knocked his head against the wall, and the concussion made this impression in the solid rock ! Such is the fable. We descended into the lower prison, and there

If further proof were needed of the fact lhat this district was once peopled, it is afforded by several large basins for collecting water, and numerous deep wells lined with masonry, to the bottom of which a commu nication is formed by means of staircases. At a distance of three hours from Adala, the road, passing over a hill, enters a morass formed by the waters sf the Gygæan lake, which sometimes overflow, and, then subsiding, leave it covered with a slimy deposit that feeds a noisome rush and engenders a pestilential miasma. This malaria has co-operated with a bad government to depopulate the country, and, extending to Sardis, has given rise to the prevalent dread of occupying a house on the site of lire once famed capital of Lydia. The road runs for two hours along this morass and scarcely emerges from it when signs of cultivation are per ceived within an hour of Marmora. The ground for many miles is covered with large pieces of quartz, schist, and mar bles of various colors, the great abundance and numerous strata of which have given its name to the town, in like man ner as the island in the Propontis is indebted for its designa tion to a similar circumstance. Marmora stands picturesquely on the acclivity of a high hill, occupying a position not unlike that of Philadelphia, and surrounded by fragments of pillars and ancient buildings scat tered about in profusion. It contains five hundred houses, of which fifty belong to Greeks, who have a miserable church sunk considerably below the level of the ground, and a priest who can scarcely read. We entered the town by night. The moon had not yet risen, and the minarets ofthe mosques were lighted up, in honor of some holiday, with lamps hung out from their galleries, communicating to the scene an air peculiarly novel and striking. The neighborhood abounds in leeches; one of which entered my mouth in a draught of milk, and adhered so fast to the gum that it was some moments before it could be disengaged. Within an hour and a half of Marmora, on the left of the road, lies the town of Giundeshlee Asrettee, the residence of a Turcoman chief named Mahmood Giundeshlee bey, who rules over the inhabitants of the wild tract occupied by emi grants from Turcomania, and borrowing from them its name. As they are all Sheeahs, or followers of Ali, they are regarded by the Turks as worse than infidels, and excluded from their government; to which disgrace they owe the privilege of hav-
001058063	001058063_223	214 ROWS OF JERICHO. Jericho, the river Jordan, and the Dead Sea; the last was then at a distance of six miles ; yet we distinctly discerned, by the yellowness of the water, the course of the sacred stream in the accursed lake. The intense azure of the sky gave something of a blue tinge to the surface of the Asphal tites; still in parts it appeared quite brown, partaking of the same leaden colour which communicates to the plain and the surrounding mountains their sombre hue; nor is it a fiction that the atmosphere is fraught with a peculiar weight and oppressiveness, at once unnatural, painful and prejudical. The plain of Jericho is about sour miles in width ; bound ed on the west by the rugged hills of Judah ; on the east by Jordan, the high land of Bashan, and the mountains of Moab; on the south by the Dead Sea ; and on the north by the val ley of the Ghor. The whole surface, formerly teeming with animation and vegetable life, producing the most luxuriant palms and balsams, and giving birth to the cities of Jericho and Ai, is now desolate ; and the few squalid Arabs who live under coverings of mud among the ruins of Jericho are eaten up with disease and wasted by constant fevers. In so re markable a change in the condition of this tract of country the Christian sees and acknowledges the hand of a righteous God who has subjected the land to a perpetual curse. But, while referring to this as the first grand cause, he will trace as secondary agents the large quantity of salt in the soil, the sulphureous exhalations of the lake of Sodom, and the vast masses of masonry that abound throughout the plain. The im pediment to a free passage of subterranean streams, offered by the substructions of cities whose names have perished with them, gives rise here, as at Athens and in the vicinity of other ruins, to a miasma which generates and perpetuates disease. It seldom happens that a European sleeps in the neighbour hood with impunity. The tent we occupied had been the property of an Englishman whose enterprising spirit led him to visit this untravelled region the preceding year; but he had scarcely succeeded in launching a boat on the Dead Sea, when he caught a fever and died. One of our party also suf fered severely from his visit to this land of death, and nearly two months elapsed before he recovered from a similar at tack. Of Jericho what shall I say . How fallen is " the city of palm trees!"* We saw but one, and that of a degenerate species. The fig tree and the vine, indeed, are not wanting; • Deut. xxxiv. 3.

[October, taste between the green fat of a turtle and the soft gristle of boiled beef, and is said to be very nutritious, but not equal to the edible bird's-nests, or nests of the sea-swallow of these seas. No less than five thousand, four hundred and eighty-six piculs of one hun dred and thirty-seven pounds each, equal to seven hundred and sixty-eight thousand and forty pounds, were shipped from this port to Canton last year, as appears by the custom-house returns, besides a large quantity smuggled. By far the larger portion is brought here by American vessels from the Fejee islands. These fish resemble, when contracted, a cucumber, and it is difficult to discover the eyes and mouth : some are black, others white, gray, Sec : they are, at present, sold at fourteen dollars per picul, the cargo. The land in the vicinity, for many miles, is low and marshy, but neatly cultivated with rice. It is surprising that health should be enjoyed at all in the midst of rice-swamps, in this sultry cli mate : thousands of huts are built in the midst of them, when it would prove fatal to the whole population in almost any other country. The healthiness of the climate, I think, must be attributed to the narrowness of that part of the island, and to the constant and refreshing breezes which dissipate its miasma. The bamboo is one of the most useful among the vegetable creation — houses, chairs, fences, settees, buckets, boxes, baskets, hats, drinking-cups, fans, mats for boats, spear-handles, sails, &c, are made of its wood ; while the tender root is served up at the table, boiled and roasted, used as a pickle and as a sweetmeat. I visited the celebrated great cigar-factory at Binondo ; about five thousand females are employed in it, and about six hundred men : it is a royal monopoly. Every person is searched twice a day to see if he pilfers any of his majesty's tobacco — he being the sole owner and master of the factory. The principal articles exported, (except gold and silver,) were indigo, sugar, rice, hemp or abacia, cotton, cocoa-nut oil, sulphur, balate, or bichos do mar, coffee, wax and hides, in the following proportions : — Indigo, thirty-one thousand, one hundred and nineteen arrobas, of which twenty-five thousand were agua rose or liquid, in jars ; sugar, six hundred and seventeen thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eight arrobas, excepting eighteen thousand arrobas of the

The tenantable houses which remain, are occupied by a squalid and sickly race of Chinese, Malays and Bugis, who are generally very poor, and live upon the scantiest substance, being unable to remove to a better country, away from the pestiferous air which destroys their health, occasioned by deleterious swamps, stagnant pools, and the miasma which is constantly generating from the decomposition of vegetable matter. It may be thought that I have given an exaggerated statement of the frightful mortality which has prevailed, and frequently does prevail at Batavia — which clothes the ground with graves, and en cumbers it with monuments ; but the returns of the Dutch records, according to Raynal, give the deaths of eigJtty-seven thousand sailors and soldiers, in the hospitals, from 1714 to 1776 ; and up ward of one million of inhabitants, in the very short space of twenty-two years, from 1730 to 1752, which can no longer leave any doubts as to its perfect correctness. , Since the walls of the city were demolished by the British, and a great number of filthy and useless canals have been filled up, the general opinion is, (and more particularly within the last half dozen years,) that the old town is rather less sickly than formerly ; how ever, no new houses are being erected within the city proper, but are extending altogether beyond the old barrier, in a southerly and easterly direction towards the country, from two to five miles, where it has been found much more healthy. Stately avenues of trees line the roads, and the few canals re maining are kept more clean than formerly. The modern houses are airy and spacious, generally of one story in height, and sur rounded generally, with very wide piazzas. The avenues leading to the houses are kept neatly gravelled ; and the grounds are adorned with trees, shrubs, and flowers : showing a correct taste which seems (to make use of a mercantile phrase) to have been imported from England, for it is quite at variance with the general style of laying out Dutch pleasure-grounds. In fact, there is an air of neatness and comfort displayed, which serves to divert the mind from dwelling too much on the fact, that you are living in the midst of this store-house of disease, where you are constantly warned by the inhabitants to keep away from every partial draft of air, for if the perspiration is checked, a fever or diarrhœa, or more 43

Water. In a complete geological work, water as a mineral, should find its place, since it plays a conspicuous part in the geolo gical history of our planet, but it would require more time than we have at present, to enter fully upon this task. I shall, therefore, only remark in general, that no country on the face of the globe is more freely supplied with water than Maine. Her lakes are innumerable, while the whole surface ofthe State presents meandering rivers, which irrigate the soil, and carry health and abundance in their course. Our lakes and rivers in northern regions, are not like those of the Western States, the abodes ofthe pestilential miasmas, but are perfectly free from any such emanations, and people live in health along their borders. This State has always been remarkable, for the freedom of her inland navigation ; canoes traverse the St. John, cruising along until they arrive where a portage of a few miles takes them into the Kennebec or Penobscot, and down they glide to the ocean ; or they may follow the Aroostic, and so trace its course as to strike the Penobscot, within the narrow portage of two miles, and then follow that great river to the sea. It is not surprising that the Indian tribes should delight in thc forests of Maine, where the birch tree, supplying them with materials for a house, and many articles of convenience, forms also their light canoe, which transports them from place to place, along the chains of lakes and rivers, as they pursue the chase. They formerly enjoyed a noble independence, and we almost grieve, when we see the scattered relics of these once powerful tribes, now reduced to the most abject state, by poverty, dependence, and intemperance.

Besides these its more familiar effects, organic affections of the spleen, liver, and mesen teric glands ; similar affections of the stomach and intestines ; dropsy, apoplexy, palsy, and idiocy, as manifested in the marshy districts of Tuscany, and in the cretinism of the valleys of Switzerland, are the effects of its long-continued application. Cholera, dysentery, and diarrhœa, are by many writers referred to its more brief agenev, and, there is reason to think, occasionally with justice ; intermittent neu ralgia (tic doloreux), there seems little doubt, is one of its effects; and to this formidable list some are disposed to add rheumatism, but the propriety of this seems doubtful." — Cyclopedia of Practical Me dicine, article Miasma, vol. iii. p. 60, &c. Dr Copland, in the last-published part of his learned Dictionarv of Medicine, gives a table of infectious agents. In this table he sets down " Miasms from decayed vegetable matter, aided by moisture in temperate ranges of atmospheric heat," as causing " catarrhal fevers, rheumatic attacks, intermittents, enlargements of the spleen, and torpid states of the liver." " Exhalations from absorbent, or deep, exuberant, and marshy soils, suspended in atmospheric humidity at temperate grades of warmth," as producing " intermittents, remittents, simple dysentery, simple cholera, bilious fevers, obstructions and other diseases of the liver and glandular organs'' " Miasms, or vapours from decayed vegetable matter, or from marshes, and rich, deep, and humid soils, at high ranges of tempera ture," as generating " inflammatory, bilious, and gastric fevers, of both a remittent and continued type, and diseases chiefly of the abdominal viscera." " Effluvia from animal matter, or from vegeto-animal matters, du- ring decomposition, aided by humidity," as the cause of " adynamic or pernicious remittents, continued fevers, adynamic dysentery, cholera, gastric, mucous, or enteric fevers." "Animal matters in a state of putridity or decomposition," as pro- ducing " diffusive or disorganizing inflammation of cellular parts, in flammation of lymphatics and of veins, <Xrc." " The effects," he observes, " or the diseases produced by infec- tion, vary with the sources and modes of infection, with the concen- tration or intensity of the infectious agents, and with the predisposi- tion or susceptibility of the persons exposed to them. It has been supposed that the terrestrial miasms, or mephitic vapours, emitted by marshes and other sources of malaria, produce only intermittent and remittent fevers. Some writers, however, have contended that true yellow fever, and even plague, also spring from these sources, aided by the influence of high ranges of temperature, and an epi- demic state ot the air.

These attacks were attributed by my father to the miasma from the marshy ground in the neighbourhood. " I have for many years attended the sick poor in St John's Hill, and I have rarely been without patients in that district. From 1st January to 31st December 1838, I find, by reference to my Dispen sary Book, that I visited at their own house, in that small and cir cumscribed locality, between ninety and a hundred sick, and of these, between thirty and forty were fever cases.

Medical Evidence given on the Trial Duncan v. the Earl of Moray. In the Introductory Note our readers will learn, that so far back as 1809, certain proprietors instituted an action to have the fulsome and nauseous practices connected with the Foul Burn restrained. The result of that action we have already stated, and only refer to it- now, that we may avail ourselves, for the public benefit, of a few extracts from the evidence tendered on the trial. It may be here perhaps proper to inform the reader, that the prin cipal grounds of complaint in that action were the nuisance and insa lubrity arising from the ponds, or stanks as they are sometimes called, in which the impure contents of the Foul Burn are allowed to stag nate for the purpose of forming manure. At the time of the trial, the F
001036234	001036234_39	42 extent of the ponds was stated to be about a Scotch acre ; and from an extract in another page, it will be seen that they are greatly increas ed since, while the irrigated land has been gradually extended, till now it amounts to hundreds of acres. The medical evidence adduced at that trial agrees strictly with the opinions we have given from the medical gentlemen who have favour ed us with their views on this subject at the present time ; and shows that the evil is not altered in the mode of its operation, nor changed in any way, except in the increased magnitude of its extent and in fluence. ' Dr Duncan, senior, at that time Professor of the Institutes of Me dicine in our University, and one of its brightest ornaments, deponed, " That he was of opinion that miasmata, particularly putrid marsh miasmata, are in every case prejudicial to health ; and during the course of his attendance at Restalrig, he had attended remittent fe vers, which he ascribed to the marsh miasmata arising from the ponds and neighbouring morass." He observed, that a disagreeable odour, injurious both to the health and comforts of the inhabitants, would arise from the water running from the City of Edinburgh, and carrying off the filth, al though it were allowed to run on in an uninterrupted stream; and gave it as his opinion, that the disagreeable and unhealthy odour is much increased by the stagnation which the pools occasion. Dr A. Duncan, junior, Professor of Medical Jurisprudence and Po lice, and of Materia Medica, corroborated the testimony of his father, as to the offensive smell issuing from the fetid pools and the influ ence of the marsh miasma in producing fever in several cases, and deponed, " That these ponds are just that artificial preparation of marsh, which, in the opinion of most medical men, is injurious to health, and, in the deponent's opinion, detracts from the comfort of those residing in the immediate vicinity." The late Mr James Russell, Professor of Clinical Surgery, and for many years an eminent surgeon in town, in his evidence deponed, " That in marshy grounds, and particularly in warm climates, and when the stagnated water is drying, what is termed miasmata is pro- duced, which occasions bad fevers and other diseases. That under the same circumstances he would expect that similar effects would fol- low in very warm weather in this country. " That if the current (of the Foul Burn) were allowed to run, and not collected in ponds, he is of opinion that the same quantity of miasmata and noxious effluvia would not be produced."

Until more complete measures could be obtained, and even as a temporary mea sure, we would recommend that the guardians should be empowered to exercise the like powers that have heretofore been exercised, and incur the like charges that have heretofore been irregularly incurred by parish-officers ; that they should be empowered to indict parties responsible for such nuisances as those described, and to make arrange ments with the owners of property, or take other measures, according to circumstances, for the removal of the causes of disease in cases where there is no ostensible party who can be required to perform that duty." * * " Report on the Prevalence of certain Physical Causes of Fever in the Metropolis, which might be removed by proper Sanatory Measures. By Neil Abnott, M. D., and James Phillips Kay, -M.D. " Among the causes w hich prevent the greater part of mankind from attaining the full age of seventy years or more, which the nature of the human constitution allows, certain poisons disseminated in the air hold a conspicuous place. Of these the most noted are the matters of smad-pox, measles, hooping cough, and that called malaria, or miasma, the chief subject of this Report, which is generated wherever animal and vegetable substances are undergoing putrefactive decom position, and which produces a great variety of fevers. " This decomposition of animal and vegetable substances takes place with rapidity proportioned to the warmth and moisture of the place, and hence it attracts attention chiefly in tropical countries where or ganized matters abound, and in low moist situations, as along flat shores, the banks of rivers, in marshy levels, and in thick forests ; it is what renders the situations described so fatal, as is known, to human inhabitants, and particularly to strangers. Englishmen, for instance, have painful mental associations with the names of many of their In dian and African colonies, as of Sierra Leone, &c, and particularly as these existed originally, when cultivation and draining were not yet begun. " Malaria differs in different situations, according to the nature of the substances and other circumstances producing it. In tropical re gions the kind produced, independently of human agency, causes the fevers to which the epithets of jungle, yellow, remittent, bilious, &c, have been applied. In more temperate climates it generates such as the fever of malaria in the Campagna di Roma, that which attacked the English army in Walcheren, and all the intermittents or agues of marshy situations. The malaria arising from matters accumulated in the business of human societies will be noticed afterwards. " The noxious activity of malaria is proportioned to its concentra tion ; hence wherever much air is passing, that is, where there is free ventilation to dilute the poison as it rises, its presence is often unper ceived. In many flat tropical islands, for instance, as in Sincapore, beyond Malacca, where the process of decomposition must be going on with great activity, because there is a constant breeze and free

And it is worthy of remark, that in the first settlements made in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, in the immediate vicinity of large groups of mounds which seem to have been con structed for the deposite of the dead, pestilential disease pre vails to a much greater extent than elsewhere. I do not suppose this result to be chargeable to the presence of the mounds, but to natural causes connected with the locality : for it is evident, that where masses of vegetable matter, so located that they are not subject to removal by water or fire, are permitted to decompose in large quantities, in positions where there are natural obstructions to a free circulation of air, a deleterious miasma must exist, bringing with it disease and death. Such localities are of frequent occurrence in tbe sudden curves and great bends of many of the western rivers, surrounded by unbroken highlands that obstruct the free cir culation of air, yet where the deepest and most fertile alluvials invite the early pioneer to rear his abode in their midst. This fact partially accounts for the frequent appearance of large burial mounds in such localities; for if the mound-builders were an agricultural people, as their works in some regions evidently indicate, the same causes operating in earlier eras, would furnish material more abundantly than higher and more salubrious lands, for the construction of those cemeteries. It may also be remarked, that in the vicinity of extensive ceme teries, it is not uncommon to see large tracts of marshy land, stagnant water, &c. ; and in the re-occupancy of these de populated regions, the pioneer will find his safety in avoiding such locations in the selection of his place of abode. That this and the surrounding country has at some era, sus tained a population which could not possibly have subsisted by fishing and hunting, is most evident from the remains of tumuli. On all tbe vast plains, for many miles above and below, bordering on the river, the truncated mound and elongated earth-work, with here and there a strange animal effigy, are to be met with ; they are also seen in great abun-

Subsequently the number has been greatly augmented. AMHERST. A small town and station, at the mouth of the Martaban river, in the Tenasserim Provinces. It stands upon a point of land running out to the north-east. The banks are level, barren, and uninterest ing, but within a short distance on the inland side of the town, rises a bold range of wooded hills. A considerable part of the cleared land in the vicinity of the town, (for untd the British took possession in 1825, the whole of the neighbourhood was a dense jungle), is now un der cultivation. Formerly the sugar-cane was much grown, and the sugar found a market in Calcutta. The manufacture is now abandoned. Amherst is about 28 miles distant from Moulmein by the river ; but by land the distance is considerably less. There is, however, no road for carriages or cattle ; a simple pathway running through swamps, and over rugged hdls forming the only7 land communication. When intedigence has to be sent to Moulmein, a boat is always employed. A detachment consisting of a Soobadar and 30 men, forms the only military force at Amherst. It is kept up mainly as a protection to the pdot station, which is indispensable for the safe navigation of ships up the river, and as a guard for the jail, wherein are 400 convicts. The rapidity of the stream, and the banks and shoals which abound in the river, render navigation without the presence of an experienced pdot extremely hazardous. It was originally contemplated by the Commander-in-Chief of the first expedition to Burmah, to fix upon Amherst as the head quarters of the British force, but the limited extent of the open ground, and the contiguity of jungle, threatening miasma and its consequences, caused Moulmein to be adopted in preference. Since the clearance of the jungle, Amherst has become compara tively health}7, so much so indeed that invalids from Moulmein fre- Q 3

In one word, we hope and pray, that, as your turn shall come to act and suffer tbe allotments of humanity, there may not be on earth one rational being who does not cheer fully acknowledge the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. To you, we must seem among the ancients ; and you may wonder how we looked, felt, and acted. The laws of Nature do not change : and your organs will obey them as do ours. You look at the light blue of the sky, or the dark blue of the ocean ; at the green grass of summer, or the yellow leaf of autumn ; at the brightness of Orion, or the mountains of the moon ; at the changing hues of sunset, or the bursting splendors of the aurora ; on the innocent gambols of a child, or the sweet smile of a parent ; on the deep sorrow of mis fortune, or the marble face of death. You look at these ; and, let us tell you, they all appeared to us exactly as they do to you. In the woods, you hear their feathered minstrelsy ; and, in the bower, the advertising cricket. At Niagara, you hear the heavy tones of its pouring ; and, on the rocky Atlantic shore, the thunder of the sea. In the angry debate, you hear the sharp voice of passion ; and, in the family circle, the sweet song of love. And, be assured, these sounds, so well known to you, were as well known to us. To you, the fragrance of the rose and tbe miasma of the fen, the sweet of honey and the bitter of wormwood, the touch of fire and the feeling of ice, are probably the very same which we have experienced. Each of our senses has carried its repor' to the brain by that faithful electricity of the nerves in which you now rejoice. Your minds, too, though enriched by superior cultivation, have attributes in common with ours. You delight to read the poems of Homer and Virgin, and repeat the orations of Demosthenes and Cicero ; you sometimes tire amid the sublimities of Milton, and love to see man and Nature lay their treasures at Shakspeare's feet. And here let us say, that your classic approbation and noble fire do not probably differ much from ours. 63

Railways are about to be con structed from Algiers to Blidah, <fec. The country is a fine school for French soldiers. The daring of the Zouaves, who are trained here, is well known.* The French say that Algeria is their Egypt, supplying them with corn. As France can grow corn enough for her own consumption and even for exportation, the remark sounds strange, but it is nevertheless true. The greater part of the wheat, some say nearly all, which is groivn in Algeria is sent to France, while most of that which is consumed in the place is imjiorted back from Marseilles. This arises partly from the knavery of the French merchants and their agents in the Al gerian towns and partly from the want of capital on the part of th*# settlers or cultivators. The cultivator lacks cash for current expenses. He applies to an agent, and receives what he requires; and when his crop is ripe, it is seized and sent to France. In hundreds of instances every year, I was assured, the agents invite the larger cultivators into a cafe and treat them to coffee and cognac; and while they are jolly and good natured, they sell their growing crops; all of which find their way to Marseilles. The cultivators are French, German, and Spanish, who are induced to settle by promises of concessions of land; but most hitherto have ended in ruin. The best land and all near the towns is given to the military and Govern ment employes, while the settlers are sent into the plains; and there thej* die as fast as if they were on the banks of the Missis sippi. I was assured that there is one village, called Boutarick, which has had a ninth change of families in it since the French took the country, nearly all having died. The marsh miasma is the cause. It is a fearful poison, generating first intermit tent fevers and then many other maladies. A single glass of unfiltered water may prove fatal. Hunters and dogs, in per fect health, have been known to be cut down in some of the marshes in a few hours; and the dogs even more quickly than the men, as they take the waters without scruple. The country is said to swarm with jackals. The French Government pays a franc and a half for every jackal that is * The Zouaves were originally a regiment formed of soldiers who were incorrigible. It was called Un Regiment Disci plinaire, which may he interpreted, '.' a Condemned Regiment." There are now several re giments of them, but by no means undisciplined ones-, for they are the best soldiers in the French army. As soon as a regiment becomes disaffected at home, it is sent to Algeria out of the way; and there the men become half wild, fearing neither God nor man, life nor death. ■
003914322	003914322_97	95 HISTORY OF BOLTON. J In May, 1854, the Right Hon. Viscount Palmerston, one of her Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, issued an order relative to the closing of burial-grounds, in the borough of Bolton, in Lancashire. Burials to be discontinued within the Parish Church forthwith; and from and after the 1st of March, 1855, in the parish churchyard, in the churchyards of St. George, the Holy Trinity, All Saints, and Christ Church ; and in the burial grounds of the following, namely, the Baptist Chapel, Moor, lane, the Wesleyan Chapel, Bridge-street, the Wesleyan Chapel, Fletcher-street, the Roman Catholic Chapel of St. Peter and St. Paul, Pilkington-street, the Independent Chapel, Mawdsley street, Albert-place Chapel, the Independent Methodist Chapel, Fold's-road, the Primitive Methodist Chapel, Higher Bridge street, the Unitarian Chapel, Deansgate, the Refugee Chapel, Hanover-street, in the Ridgway-gates Wesleyan burial-grounds, and in the Quakers' burial-ground. No more than one body to be buried in each grave, in the churciryards of Emmanuel, and of St. Stephen and all Martyrs, Lever-bridge. No coffin in these churchyards to have a covering of less than 4j feet of earth, measuring from the upper surface of the coffin to the level of the ground ; and burials to be wholly discontinued in Emmanuel churchyard, from and after the 1st of March, 1856. In Feb. 1855, the churchwardens of the parish of Bolton, sent a memorial to the Home Secretary for an extension of time, to allow the existing burial-grounds to remain open. The answer has been given to allow the memoriasists until Oct. 1st, 1855. There has been many places which would answer the purpose of a cemetery, and all of them appeared to be eligible. One of them behind the church at Astley-bridge, another at Brackley Park, a third in the same neighbourhood, a fourth in Tonge, on land belonging to Mr. Starkie. It is well that the legislature have decreed that the cemete ries of the churches and chapels, in the towns and other places in the kingdom, shall cease to bury their dead ; and to provide suitable burial-grounds at a distance How dangerous to the public health are the putrid exhalations of our churchyards to the inhabitants. The smell arising, in which so many corpses are interred, especially in spring, when the earth begins to yearn with the heat of the season. The miasma arising is cor rupted and impure, and has a tendency to increase the small pox and putrid fevers, which are generally prevalent in the spring.

Watkin Wynne, deputy to Sir Watkin Williams Wynne, Bart.," wheu John Hughes, Esq., of Llainwen, father of the present high-steward, was recorder. — See page 258. The chamberlains kept the records, issued " writs," &c, and received the revenue ; and may, indeed, be taken as the recorders of early times. This tower was fifteen yards long and ten broad, and two stories high, with a fine archway or gate. It communicated with the castle, both by a gallery, and a private passage formed in the thickness of the wall, and also joined the Town Walls, but was " much in decay" three hundred years back. Indeed, it is not impossible that it was one of the earliest portions of the fortifications, and, for anything we can find to the contrary, it may have existed in the time of Henry III. Our ancestors fancied that they often witnessed the midnight balls of the Fairies on the slope of the hill, under the old Exchequer Tower, by "the silver light of the moon," to which the poet refers in the following beautiful verse :-»■ "And now, how sweet the dulcet tunes enchant mine ear, Oh ! where's the magic touch from whence they're drawn; I see ! yes, elfin spirits fill the air, And minstrel shades in majesty are borne." This tower commanded a charming view of the west-end of the town,* and of a circumscribed range of a fine undulating country. * It is remarkable that the wealthier inhabitants of nearly all towns and cities group themselves to the west, but the very reverse is the case here ; for the neigh- bourhood of Henllan-street, is the St. Giles of Denbigh — the most squalid and disreputable quarter of the town. It was originally the "suburb inhabited by Welsh formers." But although the west winds are those which most frequently prevail, the smoke and miasma of this low locality are not blown into the east part of the town, but through the hollow or pass on the north side, and become dispersed over the distant country. Hence the elite of Denbigh congregate towards the east end, or old Enghsh quarter, and very few country towns can boast of such a street as Vale-street ; not only for its great length and width, but on account of its being studded with so many " fair and goodly houses," and being withal richly wooded.

It contains thirtx - two thousand square miles. The physical features of Circassia have been generally described in the notice of the Caucasian range on a previous page, and what is peculiar to Circassia is only the consequence of that country's occupying the northern slope ofthe mountains. With the exception of the lowlands on the bank of the Kouban and Terek, the whole territory is broken into precipitous mountains, small table-lands, and valleys of the most picturesque and ro mantic description. Its hydrography belongs to two systems, the waters of Kabardah (the eastern section) being all conveyed by the Terek to the Caspian, and those of western Circassia by the Kouban to the Black sea. The former river rises near the Kazbek, and, forcing its way through the pass of Dariel (the ancient "Caucasian Gate"), receives, directly or indi rectly, thirty-five streams before it quits the Circassian country. Of these, the Malk, which joins it at its eastern bend, is scarcely inferior in size to the principal river. It rises near the eastern bases of the Elbrouz, and is itself the recipient of a considerable number of tributaries. The Kouban rises on the northern base of the Elbrouz, not far from the sources of the Malk, and receives the water of more than fifty rivers, thirty of which fall directly into its bed. It has every reason to be considered exclusively a Circassian river ; for, though no part of its northern bank be inhabited by Circassians, it does not receive a single tributary, in its whole course, that does not rise within their territory. A similar remark will apply, in a modified sense, to the Terek, which, like the Kouban, does not receive a single stream from the north, and only one of consequence after entering the Tartar country east of Little Kabardah. The country between the sources of the Malk and Kouban is watered by various streams ; and when it is recollected that, in addition to these, innumerable torrents pour from the upper ranges of the mountains, it will be evident that no land can be better irrigated. The water is in general clear and good, but occasionally impregnated with mineral and other extraneous matters. The tributary streams become flooded in winter, and extremely shallow during the heats of summer ; the currents of all are extremely rapid, as are those also of the Terek and Kouban, except where the latter forms morasses, which it does in some parts of the flat country, when its course becomes sluggish, and its water thick and muddy. The climate, soil, and natural productions of Circassia, are also the same with those ofthe Caucasus generally ; but the temperature is rather lower than on the southern slopes, except on the banks of the Kouban, where the greater depression more than compensates for the difference of aspect, and where the extensive marshes and the exuberant vegetation create miasma, which render it more pestilential than any other district in the whole region. There is a greater proportion of bare rock in Circassia than in Georgia aud the other countries south of the main ridge; but on every sh If, and

" On the 22d of July," says Cailliaud, " I paid a visit to the former king, Bady. I found him seated on a stool, in one of the courts of his residence, where he enjoyed the fresh air, with his ministers and some persons of his suite at his side. He ordered a straw mat to be brought, on which I placed myself. He was dressed in a broad shirt of white linen ; his legs were bare, his feet covered with long sandals, and the royal cap upon his head. A servant brought him a pipe of the com monest kind used in the country. Bady is a man of about forty years old, of middling height, robust, of an agreeable figure, with crisp hair and a coppery complexion, which is that ofthe race of Foungi, to which he belongs. He asked me what difference I found between my country and his, believing me to be from Constantinople, and I drew a picture which threw his own capital quite into the shade. ' At present,' said he, ' Sennaar is no longer to be recognized ; it is very different from what it was in the times of my ancestors.' Then, with a visible emotion, he bade me see all around him the ruins of the palace of his father, which still overlooks the whole city. ' These ruins,' said he, ' are the remains of the power of my ancestors, the limits of whose kingdom once reached to the confines of Dongola.' Having nothing worthy of his rank to offer him, I gave him one of my boxes of oxygenated matches. When he saw one of them ignite in the sulphuric acid, he called upon the name of the Prophet, and exhibited the greatest sur prise." In the beginning of August, the pasha, in a conversation with Cail liaud, praised the climate of Sennaar, and declared that the contrary accounts given by Bruce were totally false. Only one month of the rainy season had passed ; the rain had not been frequent nor the heat excessive, and there was no sickness among the troops. " The rains cease at the end of September. The soil, profoundly saturated, retains here and there pools of st.agnant water, which, fermenting by the sud den action ofthe beat, exhale putrid miasma. These, joined to the not less pernicious vapors ofthe earth, vitiate the air, and engender a host of maladies ; the fevers, above aU, prevaU until January. At the ap proach of this disastrous season, the inhabitants of the banks of the river hasten to desert the vUlages with their beasts, and to fly from the pestiferous atmosphere." Twenty days after this conversation with the pasha, malignant fevers, dysenteries, and affections of the liver, threat ening an epidemic, prevailed among the troops. M. Letorzec, the in terpreter, and two of Cailliaud's Arab servants, became very ill, and six of the Greek and Italian physicians ofthe army died. " By the 25th of September, there were six hundred deaths and two thousand sick, in an army of three thousand men, and the number increased every day. During the whole campaign, the army had never before been in so pitiable a condition. The pasha, in despair, drew up an account of his
000092983	000092983_66	50 PHYSICAL GEOGBAPHY. connected with, and dependent on, these modifications. Even the deposit of dew, the gentlest of atmospheric changes, as weU as the formation of mists, fogs, and clouds, and the falling of ram, snow, aud hah, must be regarded as both consequent upon and causing great electric disturbance. When serene the atmosphere almost alwavs indicates positive electricity. Violent storms occur frequently in the tropics, and are caUed hurricanes, tornados and typhoons, but they are generaUy much limited in extent and direction. They advance from one point with a powerful and rapid gyratory motion combined with a direct progress ; but whUe the latter is often not more than eight or ten nhles an hour, the former is sometimes 50 or 60 mUes, or even more, producing destruction in the course of the storm from the irresistible force acquired by such extreme rapidity. AU of them are referable to electrical changes, which have been generaUy in duced by great and unequal distribution of heat. (See § 88.) 83. Winds or currents of air are portions of the atmosphere set in motion, in consequence of one part being displaced by some local cause, and another part rushing in to supply the vacant place. Winds keep the atmosphere permanently in a state of complete mixture of the component parts. They help to purify it by remov ing miasma and exhalations locaUy injurious, but admitting of such dUution as to be ultimately harmless : they favour and assist in the fecundation of plants by the distribution of poUen : — they modify and equahze the temperature of various parts of the surface : — they convey clouds, and thus distribute moisture, and render the interior of continents fertile ; but sometimes they carry with them poison and death, for they bear along the insects and the bhght that often destroy the hopes of the husbandman, and the fever that baffles the skill of the physician. 84. GeneraUy if two districts are unequaUy heated a cold wind wUl set in near the surface from the less heated to the more heated district,whUe a corresponding current in the opposite direction takes place in the upper regions of the atmosphere. Thus, when the sun shines during the day, and land and water are equaUy exposed to its influence, the land is more heated than the water, and a cool breeze is soon felt setting in landwards ; whUe in the evening, when the sun has set, and the greater radiation cools the earth sooner than the water, the converse takes place, and in this way are ex plained the phænomena of land and sea breezes, and numerous ap parent anomalies observed in local prevalent winds. 85. The trade-winds are periodical winds, occurring near the tropics in the open ocean. The portion of the earth near the equator being the hottest part of the globe, the air over it is there more heated than elsewhere, whUe on the other hand the regions

The former group contain the Pelew Islands, and with the latter are remarkable for their beauty- and fertility, the climate being tem perate and agreeable ; many of them are uninhabited. 59. Java, or Yava as the name is sometimes pronounced, lies to the S. of Borneo, and to the S. E. of Sumatra, from which last it is separated by a narrow strait, called thc Strait of Sunda ; and hence all the neighbouring islands are frequently called tho Sunda Isles: the sea between it and Borneo is named thc Java Sea. Java is nearly 600 miles long, in an Easterly and Westerly direction, and generally about 80 broad ; it is volcanic in its form ation, many ofthe mountains attaining an altitude of 10,000 feet, though the average elevation is not great ; it is very fertile, and remarkable as being the only one of tliese islands which produces the teak tree. In 1478 it was taken from the Hindoos by the Arabs. The Portuguese formed a settlement here in 151 l,and the Dutch took possession in 1575; it was held by the British from 1811 to 1816. There were several native states in the island in nominal subjection to the Dutch, who have divided the island into 22 residencies. The Javanese appear to have once professed the Hindoo religion, but the predominant faith at present is that of Mahomet, adulterated by many superstitious notions and obser vances. Batavia, the capital of Java, and the metropolis of all the Dutch or Netherland possessions in the East India Islands, is situated on the Northern coast of the island, not far from its Western extremity. It was founded by the Dutch in 1619. It stands in a low marshy plain, at the union of several small rivers, which are only navigable for boats ; and in many of the streets are canals filled with water almost stagnant. The miasma generated in the putrid mud banks and canals, renders the town exceedingly unhealthy; it has, however, of late been improved by draining. Batavia, on account ofthe beauty of its buildings and immense trade, has been styled The Queen of the East, but it has lost a great part of its splendour and importance; the number of its inhabitants has decreased, but may be estimated as approaching 120,000. 60. There is an extensive chain of islands stretching from the Eastern extremity of Java to the South Western part of New Guinea, known by the names of Bally, Lomboch, Sumbawa, Floris, Timor, Timorlaut, and Aroo. They are inhabited by a half civilized race of people, governed by rude laws, some of whom profess the Mahometan religion, but by far the larger number follow the doctrines of Buddha. The principal island is Timor, at the South Western extremity of which is the settlement of Coepang, belonging to the Dutch, to whom also the greater part of the coast is nominally subject. Dltelli or Dilli lies on the North Western side of Timor, and is the miserable relic of the extensive possessions once belonging to the Portuguese in this quarter of the globe.
001413624	001413624_131	DOCUMENTARY HISTORY OF 118 prisoners on Gates' defeat, experienced the first effects of the cruel ty of their new system. 1 These men were confined on board of prison-ships, in numbers by no means proportioned to the size of the vessels, immediately after a march of one hundred and twenty miles, in the most sickly season of this unhealthy climate. ' These vessels were in general infected with the Small-Pox ; ve ry few of the prisoners had gone through that disorder. A repre sentation was made to the British Commandant of their situation, and permission was obtained for one of our Surgeons to inoculate them — this was the utmost extent of their humanity — the wretched objects were still confined on board of the prison-ships, and fed on salt provisions, without the least medical aid, or any proper kin 1 of nourishment. The effect that naturr.lly followed, was a Small-Pox with a fever of the putrid type; and to such as survived the Small- Pox, a putrid dysentery — and, from these causes, the deaths of a1 least one hundred and fifty of llio unhappy victims. Such were the appearances, and such was the termination of the generality of the cases brought to the general hospital after the eruption of the Small-Pox — before, the eruption, not a single individual was suffer ed to be brought on shore. If any thing can surpass the above re lation in barbarity, it is the following account : ' The Continental iroops, by the articles of capitulation, were to be detained prisoners in some place contiguous to Charleston; the barracks were pitched on as the proper place ; this was agreed to by both parties. The British, in violation of their solemn compact, put these people on board of prison-ships Confined in large num bers on board of these vessels, and fed on salt provisions in this cli mate in the months of October and November, they natural .y gen erated a putrid fever from the human miasma. This soon became highly contagious. The sick brought into the general hospital from the prison-ships, generally died in the course of two or three days, with all the marks of a highly septic state. Application was made to Mr. De Rosette, the British commissary of prisoners; the vast increase of the numbers of dea'hs was pointed out, and he was re quested to have proper steps taken to check the progress of a dis order that threatened to destroy the whole of the prisoners.

In noticing the temperature of our atmosphere, it may be said, that the thermometer ranges from 10 de grees below zero to 92 above, as the extreme. In sum mer, its general range is from 70 to 80. In winter, from 8 below to 12 above. We have no tempests like those which rise and accumulate, and destructively sweep over extensive plains. The north-west wind is to us strong and piercing, especially in winter ; in summer, it is pe culiarly refreshing. The east and north-east winds are very chilly and heavy. The south wind and those east or west of it are loaded with vapor, and accompanied with a degree of warmth and rarity which, if continued a day or two, becomes oppressive to the invalid, and in a measure destroys the usual elasticity of our atmosphere. This state of the air is not very common, and we have so few undrained swamps and marshes, and those of small extent and so frequently replenished with pure water from the clouds, that they affect us but little, if at all ; of course, our air is generally pure and salubrious, and the brisk winds which are generally in motion tend to keep it so, thus, in most situations, we inhale the life giving breeze, unlike the atmosphere in some parts of our country, where the air is stagnant as the water over which it broods, and from which it imbibes miasma deleterious as the exhalations from the Upas, and when set in motion by the breeze, scatters pale disease and death around. Now, reader, for the warring elements. When the east and north-east winds have brought from their winter stores immense bodies of vapor, and covered the surface of our hills and valleys with a wallowing depth of snow, the wind turns into the north-west and rises in its strength and majesty, sweeps away the clouds that have been

XXXVIII. And in the people themselves the convulsive agitation of a revolution of three years' duration, the dread of losing a conquest they valued the more from its being the more re cent and more contested ; the incessant fever which the tribunes, the journals, and the clubs disseminated each day among the populace ; the cessation of labor, the prospects of the agrarian law, and general pillage by those greedy of gain, despairing patriotism, the treason of the generals, the invasion of the frontiers, the Vendeans setting up the standard of royalism and religion, the scarcity of money, the famine panic, the thirst of blood inspired by the days of the 14th of July, 6th of October, 10th of August, the 2d of September, and that furious rage for extermination, which lurks in the instincts of the multitude, which awakes in time of great commotion, and which demands to gorge itself with blood when it has once tasted it — such were the elements of the Terror. Calculation in some, entrltine ment in others ; weakness in these, concession in those ; feai- and passion in the greater number ; a moral epidemic tainting an already vitiated air, and from which predis posed minds no more escape than morbid bodies from a prevailing disease ; a contagion to which every one lends his share of miasma and complicity ; the Terror sprang from itself, and died as it was born, when the tension of affairs was relaxed, without being conscious of its death, any more than it was conscious of its birth. Such is the progress of human things, for which our infirmity leads us to seek one cause, when it results from a thousand different and complicated causes ; and to which is given the name of one man, when they should bear the name of the period. XXXIX. Could the Convention altogether discard the necessity of an arbitrary and dictatorial government, armed with power ful intimidation, under the circumstances in which the republic — France — and even itself was placed ?

At four o'clock they rolled, more or less laden, by the Pont-au-Change, and the Rue Saint Honore, toward the Place of the Revolution. They delayed their route to prolong the spectacle to the people, and the punishment to the victims. Thus died, decimated among the chosen, all classes of the population — nobility, churchmen, citizens, magistracy, merchants, and even the people themselves ; thus died all the great and obscure citizens who represented rank in France, the professions, science, situations, riches, indus try, opinion, and sentiment, proscribed by the sanguinary regeneration of terror. Thus fell, one by one, four thousand heads in some months, among whom were the Montmoren cies, the Noailles, the La Rochefoucaulds, the Maillys, the Mouchys, the Lavoisiers, the Nicolais, the Sombreuils, the Brancas, the Broglies, the Boisgelins, the Beauvilliers, the Mailles, the Montalemberts, the Roquelaures, the Rouchers, the Cheniers, the Grammonts, the Duch.telets, the Cler mont-Tonneres, the Thiards, the Moncrifs, and the Mole- Champlatreux. Democracy usurped its place with the knife; but in taking that place, it outraged humanity. XX. The regular passage of these processions of the scaffold, after having been long a spectacle and a kind of sinister il lustration for the streets which they borrowed, and, above all, for the Rue St. Honore, had become a punishment and a species of disgrace to these quarters. The passengers avoided them. The windows, the shops, the stores, were closed at the approach of these funeral processions. The vociferations of the mob frightened the citizens even in their hearths, who dwelt in these streets, and scared children in the arms of their mothers. Tenants abandoned their domi ciles. Proprietors commenced complaining in petitions to the Commune, that their houses had been converted into licensed places of punishment. The blood of two or three thousand victims which had gushed out since the spring upon the pavement of the Place of the Revolu tion, as in a slaughter-house of men, stained the ground, and infected the air. The Tuileries and the Champs Elysees were deserted by the crowd of promenaders. The miasma of death corrupted the shade of the trees. Two executions, mon' inauspicious and more- solemn

After leaving the Santaam, a prairie commences, of from sour to twelve miles in width, which continues up the valley for a day's travel, which I suppose to be about forty miles. The mountains upon the east side of the AVillamette are cov ered with timber of quite large growth. In this last prairie has been sound some stone coal, near the base of the mountain spurs ; but as to quantity or quality I am uninformed. The specimen tried by a blacksmith was by him pronounced to be good. The AVillamette valley, including the first plateaus of the Cascade and Coast ranges of mountains, may be said to aver age a width of about sixty, and a length of about two hundred miles. It is beautifully diversified with timber and prairie. Unlike our great prairies east of the Rocky Mountains, those upon the waters of the Pacific are quite small ; instead of dull aud sluggish streams, to engender miasma to disgust and disease man, those of this valley generally run quite rapidly, freeing the country of such vegetable matter as may fall into them, and are capable of being made subservient to the will and comfort of the human family in propelling machinery. Their banks are generally lined with fine groves of timber for purposes of utility, and adding much to please the eye. The AA'illamette itself, throughout its length, has generally a growth of fir and white cedar, averaging from one-fourth to three miles in width, which are valuable both for agricultural and commercial purposes. Ils banks are generally about twenty feet above the middling stages, yet there are some low ravines, (in the country called slues.) which are silled with water during freshets, and at these points the bottoms are overflowed; but not more so than those upon the rivers east of the Mississippi. It has been already observed that the soil in these bottoms and in the prairies is very rich ; it is a black alluvial deposite of muck and loam ; in the timbered portions it is more inclined to be sandy, and the higher ground is of a reddish colored clay and loam. The whole seems to be very productive, especially of wheat, for which it can be safely said, that it is not excelled by any portion of the continent. The yield of this article has frequently been fifty bushels per acre, and in one case Dr. AVhite harvested from ten acres an average of over fifty-four

Another cause which contributes to render these countries healthy and pleasant to live in is, that there are, properly speak ing, no swamps, marshes, nor bayous, as in the United States, and in the neighbourhood of Acapulco and West Alexico. These lakes and bayous drying during summer, and exposing to the rays of the sun mdlions of dead fish, impregnate the atmosphere with miasma, generating typhus, yellow fever, dysenteries, and pulmonary diseases. If the reader will look over the map I have sketched of the Shoshone country, he wdl perceive how wed the land is watered ; the lakes are ad transparent and deep, the rivers run upon a rocky bottom as well as all the brooks and creeks, the waters of which are alw*ays cool and plentiful. One more observation to convince the reader of the superiority of the clime is, that, except a few ants in the forests, there are no insects whatever to be found. No musquitoes, no prairie horse-flies, no beetles, except the coco nilla or large phosphoric fly of California, and but very few worms and caterpillars ; the consequence is, that there are but two or three classes of the smaller species of carnivorous birds ; the large ones, such as the common and red-headed vulture and crow, are very convenient, fulfilling the office of general scavengers in the prairies, where every year thousands of wild cattle die, either from fighting, or, when in the central deserts, from the want of water. On the western coast, the aspect of the country, in general, is gently diversified ; the monotony of the prairies in the interior being broken by islands of fine timber, and now and then by mountains projecting boldly from their bases. Near the sea shore the plains are intersected by various ridges of mountains, giving birth to thousands of small rapid streams, which carry their cool and limpid waters to the many tributaries of the sea, which are very numerous between the mouth of the Calumet and Buonaventura. Near to the coast lies a belt of lofty pines and shady odoriferous magnolias, which extends in some places to the very beach and upon the high cliffs, under which the shore is so bold that the largest man-of-war could sail without danger. I remember to have once seen, above the bay of San Francisco, the sadors of a Mexican brig sitting on the ends of their topsail yards, and picking the flowers from the branches of the trees as they glided by.

XXIX.] DIMENSIONS OF NEW FISSURES. 459 Dimensions of new Fissures and Chasms. — According to Grimaldi, many fissures and chasms, formed by the first shock of February 5th, were greatly widened, lengthened, and deepened by the violent con vulsions of March 28th. In the territory of San Fili this observer found a new ravine, half a mile in length, two feet and a half broad, and twenty-five feet deep ; and another of similar dimensions in the territory of Rosarno. A ravine nearly a mile long, 105 feet broad, and thirty feet deep, opened in the district of Plaisano, where, also, two gulfs were caused — one in a place called Cerzulle, three quarters of a mile long, 150 feet broad, and above one hundred feet deep ; and another at La Fortuna, nearly a quarter of a mile long, above thirty feet in breadth, and no less than 225 feet deep. In the district of Fosolano three gulfs opened : one of these measured 300 feet square, and above thirty feet deep ; another was nearly half a mile long, fifteen feet broad and above thirty feet deep ; the third was 750 feet scpiare. Lastly a calcareous mountain, called Zefirio, at the southern extremity of the Italian peninsula, was cleft in two for the length of nearly half a mile, and an irregular breadth of many feet. Some of these chasms were in the form of a crescent. The annexed cut (fig. 59. ) represents one by no means remarkable for its dimensions, which remained open by the side of a small pass over the hill of St. Angelo, near Soriano. The small river Mesima is seen is the foreground. Fig. 59. Chasm in the hill of St. Angelo, near Soriano, in Calabria, caused by the earthquake of 1783. Formation of new lakes. — In the vicinity of Seminara, a lake was suddenly formed by the opening of a great chasm, from the bottom of which water issued. This lake was called Lago del Tolfilo. It extended 1785 feet in length, by 937 in breadth, and 52 in depth. The inhabitants, dreading the miasma of this stagnant pool, en deavoured, at great cost to drain it by canals, but without success, as it was fed by springs issuing from the bottom of the deep chasm. A small circular subsidence occurred not far from Polistena, of which a representation is given below.

" We were visited again with grievous sickness in 1757, the same illness we had last year. From the beginning of July to the middle of October, there were 219 persons sick, of which number 25 died, 17 heads of families. "In 1758, we were again visited with the same grie vous illness we have been for two years before. From the first of August to the middle of October, there were 96 persons sick of the fever, of which number 11 died, 7 of whom were heads of families.3 3 January 3, 1760, was set apart by Mr. Emerson, his church and congre gation, as a day of thanksgiving, " to commemorate the goodness of God to them the year past, especially in the removal of sickness and the return of so many soldiers from the army." In the sermon preached on this occasion, Mr. Emerson says, " It pleased God, in the summer of 1755, to visit us with that grievous fever, by which we have suffered so much, and which hath, from its beginning with us, obtained the name of the Pepperell fever." The district contained about ninety families. After enumerasing its ravages in four successive years, he sums up the whole thus: "In the four years abovementioned, there were above 540 persons sick; 103 died, of whom 16 were soldiers from home, or just after their return ; no less than 48 heads of families; 64 grown persons. How great was our distress for two years, especially in the height of the sickness, and we, notwithstanding, obliged to find our quota for the war ! I know not that we were eased more than a single man, excepting the time of the general alarm, when fort William Henry was besieged, in 1757, when our proportion was above twenty men at which time there were not so many able to bear arms in the place, besides those who were necessarily taken up in attending on the sick in their own families, the field officers were so good as not to call for any. One of the years, there were near 200 confined at the same time. Your pastor at the point of death, and then confined from the house of God for four months. And of this large number who have been sick, I know not of ten persons who have been visited with the same distemper twice. Nor should we forget the bounty we received by order of authority, namely, fifty pounds, to be distributed amongst the greatest sufferers." The proximate cause of this Pepperell fever has been thought to be the miasma arising from decayed vegetable matter. The swamp or meadow of John Shattuck, near Henry Jewett's, had been overgrown with bushes and various vegetables ; and in order to kill them and bring the land into a state of cultivation, a dam was built and the swamp overflowed with water.

A single canoe generally contains a family and all the personal property of the establishment. At this period the aurora is remarkably brilliant, and snipe, woodcock, and other birds of passage, take their flight to the south. No very satisfactory explanation of the phenomena of this peculiar season has yet been given. It is probable, however, that its chief cause is the rapid decomposition of the fallen leaves, and other vegetable matter, hastened by night-frosts and the heat of the sun at mid-day. The great quantity of gases thus evolved doubtless effect important changes in the atmosphere and its temperature. The electricity of the earth, from being greatly increased, may also promote the expansion of the aurora at the time. Under a general view, the climate of New Brunswick is decidedly healthy, and there is no disease peculiar to the country : still, it is propel* to speak of it with some degree of circumspection in reference to the Bay-of- Fundy coast. The humidity of the atmosphere and fogs of this shore induce coughs, influenzas, rheumatism, and pulmonary consumption ; yet, those diseases are not more frequent here than they are at New York, where one-seventh of the deaths are from pulmonary complaints. The intermittent fever, an acknowledged drawback on the settlement of Upper Canada, and the terror of the inhabitants of more southern latitudes, is unknown in the Province — indeed, it cannot exist there, and patients who are affected by it are soon restored to health after landing upon her shores. In the interior, the diseases are few and comparatively simple. Fevers of a typhoid character are most prevalent, but they are gene rally mild. When the intervales and marshes of the country shall have been drained, and the rising of miasma thus checked, such fevers will in a great degree subside. From the vicissitudes of the weather, and the exposure of many of the inhabitants, especially the lumbermen, in rafting timber upon the waters, inflammations are not unfrequent ; but * Children.

The average of the mortality for five year's is less than one per cent. ; in England, it is 213. From the calculations of Mr. Dutton, the coldest day was in June, 1844, when the thermometer was 47£°, and the warmest day in January, 1845 — at noon it stood at 106°. The average of the annual quantity of rain which fell in South Australia is 19-902. The longest day, in December, is 14 hours ; shortest, in June, 10 hours. It is surprising how long this fine region was neglected. In 1836 its woods resounded to the war-cry of the naked savage. In 1839, there were introduced from New South Wales, 4,200 horned cattle; 130 horses; 35,000 sheep; and the first three months of 1840, 7,000 horned cattle ; 100 horses, and 25,000 sheep, the total being valued at £230,800 in fifteen months.

In 1845, there were 480,669 sheep, 26,146 horned cattle, and 1,044 horses assessed as stock in South Australia. The agricultural resources of the colony are quite equal to the pastoral. The official return of acres in cultivation imder wheat, barley, oats, maize, and potatoes, was in 1840 — 2,503 ; 1841 — 6,722 ; 1842—19,790; 1843—28,690; 1844—26,918; 1845, upwards of 30,000 acres. The produce is exported to Sydney, New Zealand, Van Diemen's Land, Swan River, Mauritius, Singapore, Cape of Good Hope, and England. "The South Australian" of the 13th of April last, states, " that 660 acres of land, situate at Lyndock Valley, produced 28 bushels per acre.

The night was clear, a thin mist hung over the southern shore, and the moon was nearly at the full. Near us, when all was still, the sea had the exact hue of absinthe, or that peculiar blue of the grotto of "Azzura," described in the " Improvisatore." Until 2 A. M. the night was serene and lovely. Although the earth was fine and penetrating as ashes, and the miasma from the marsh anything but agreeable, there were no fleas, and the bites which had so smarted from the spray yesterday, are now healing up. To-night our Bedawin had a farewell feast, characteristic alike of their habitual waste and want of cleanliness. A huge kettle, partly filled with water, was laid on a fire made of wood gathered on the beach and strongly impregnated with salt ; when the water boiled, a quantity of flour was thrown in and stirred with a branch of drift-wood, seven feet long, and nine inches in circumference. When the mixture was about the consistence of paste, the vessel was taken from the fire and a skin of rancid butter, about six pounds, in a fluid state, was poured in ; the mixture was again stirred, and the Bedawin seated round it scooped out the dirty, greasy compound, with the hollow of their hands — 'Akil not the least voracious among them. He is a genuine barbarian, and never sleeps even beneath the frail covering of a tent. In his green aba, which he has constantly worn since he joined us, he is ever to be found at night, slumbering, not sleeping, near the watch-fire — his yataghan by his side — his heavy mounted, wide mouthed pistols beneath his head. Before retiring, the Arabs took an impressive leave of us ; for it was evident that they anticipated encountering some peril in their route along the eastern shore. The Arab bard sang nearly the whole night. Stopping a little after midnight, he commenced again in less than an hour, and at 2 A.

An occasional scream or yell would have been absolute relief.

America attracted by gold has pushed forward her commercial pioneers, not only to the extremity of her territories, but to all the islands ot the Pacific. The discovery of gold in California was scarcely less momentous to the Australasian than to the American continent. They are now our nearest neighbours : their markets are affected by our own ; their territory offers the quickest transit to Europe; every hour will develop the immense importance of this contiguity — that passage across the isthmus of Panama, ouce represented as the last achievement reserved for com merce and science in their highest maturity, has already been assured. The common interest of trading nations will strengthen the securities of peace, diffuse civilisation among the thousand islands of the Pacific, and facilitate the extension of Christian knowledge in the remotest portions of the earth. England, the parent — no longer the exclusive centre of Anglo-Saxon civilisation — will find auxiliaries only less powerful than herself in a work once entirely her own. An impetus has been given to the Australian colonies by the discovery of still richer gold fields than those of California. In six months, more than two millions in value has been taken from the surface of the earth by laborers unskilled in the process, and who have perhaps wasted more than they have secured. The riches which remain scattered over many hundred miles can only be appropriated by the state as they flow through the coffers of commerce. A period cannot be imagined when the precious metal will be exhausted. The interest excited in Europe by the discovery of new mineral wealth, is chiefly important from its tendency to change the current of emigration to these regions — certainly unsuipassed and scarcely equalled in the world. Here, under a tropical sun, no fever rages; here indigenous diseases are unknown ; even those so fatal in Europe rarely visit this hemisphere. The small pox, the measles, and various other disorders fatal to infancy are only occasionally seen, and are scarcely ever mortal. No miasma arises from the marshes : no decaying vegetation poisons the virgin soil. The clement skies and light atmosphere stimulate and con firm the health. Whether long life is the gift of this quarter of the globe is hardly yet determined. Those of middle age who land here find their constitutions recruited ; but the country-born come more quickly to maturity. It is probable, however, that the highest average of human life will be attained : fewer will die in infancy, perhaps a smaller proportionate number reach old age.
002435996	002435996_214	205 TAMAULIPAS BOUNDARIES RIVERS LAGUNES. THE STATE OF TAMAULIPAS. This State was known, previous to the revolution, as the Iten dencia de San Luis Potosi, and included the colony of Nuevo Santander. It is now bounded on the north by the North American State of Texas ; on the north-west by the Mexican State of Coa huila; on the west by the States of New Leon and San Luis Potosi; on the south by San Luis Potosi and Vera Cruz ; and, on the east, by the Gulf of Mexico. The breadth of the State varies from twelve to fifty-five leagues. The coast of Tamaulipas is more than three hundred and fifty miles in length, and is fringed with lagunes, varying from four to eighteen miles in width, which are divided from the gulf by barriers and banks of sand. The shallowness of the shores along the whole of this coast, and the dangerous bars which choke the mouths of the rivers, render the navigation difficult and dangerous for vessels of almost all classes. In the northern part of the State, in the neighborhood of the Rio Grande, the country is comparatively level. South of these high plains, however, and some distance in the interior, the land is varied by a succession of mountains, hills and vallies, which gradually slope eastwardly until they ate lost in the flats and sands of the sea coast. The Cerro de Martinez, the Cerro de Xeres, the Cerro del Coronel, and the mountain ridges, or sierras, de la Palma and del Carico, are the most remarkable elevations. The land is well watered. Fine vallies extend along the Rio del Norte or Rio Grande, the Tigre, Borbon, Panuco and Dolores. On the coast are found the lagunes of La Madre, Morales and Tampico. The climate of the interior of Tamaulipas is mild and healthy; but on the coast an intense heat prevails during the greater part of the year, and, combined with the rank vegetation and moisture, produces diseases similar to those which scourge the adjacent shores of Vera Cruz. As soon as the northers begin to blow, all nature — animal and vegetable — is refreshed by the grateful change; but the hot season generally recommences in March, and soon spreads miasma and death throughout the whole of the low lands. The population of Tamaulipas, — consisting chiefly of Meztizos and Indians, — was estimated by the Mexican Calendar of 1833, at 166,824, who were divided among three departments and eleven districts or cantons. In 1842 the population, as stated in the estimate lor a congress, was 100,068 ; and if to this we add ten per cent, for the estimated increase in seven years, we shall have 110,074 in 1850.

The burning sun of the coast acts rapidly upon these shallow marshes and fills them with insects and miasma. San Bias soon becomes uninhabitable, and its population betake themselves either to Tepic, Guadalajara, or the first elevations of the mountains in the interior. The only mining region of any note in Jalisco is that of Bolanos. The mines of Hostotipaquillo, near Tepic, are now abandoned ; those of Guichichila, Santa Maria del Oro, Santa Martin and Ameca, in the district of Etzatlan, in the neighborhood of Cocula, are partially wrought. Among the unexplored sites of base and spurious metals in this State, we may mention those found in the vicinity of Compostella, those near the ranchos of Rosa Morada and Buena Vista, towards the coast, between the villages of Santiago and Acaponeta, and those near Guajicoria, north of the last named village. The Islands of La Isabela, San Juanico and Marias, lie on the Pacific coast of Jalisco. The aborigines of Jalisco, formerly warlike and devoted to a bloody religion, belong to the tribes of Cazcanes, Guachichiles and Guamanes. They are most generally tillers of the ground, ad hering to the doctrines of the Catholic church, and they have par ticular fondness for settling a while in lonely and wild regions, and for changing their place of residence frequently. The manners and customs of the Guachichiles are in many respects peculiar. They still use the bow and arrow as weapons. Their quivers are made of deer and shark skins, and the points of their reed arrows are formed of a hard wood and rarely of copper. The garments of the men consist of a kind of short tunic, roughly made by themselves of blue or brown cotton material, with a girdle hanging down in front and behind, to which is generally added a pair of trousers of tanned goat or deer skin. Married persons, men as well as women, wear straw hats with broad rims and high crowns, ornamented with a narrow ribbon of bright colored wool and tassels. Their black bushy hair is worn very long, bound with bright colored ribbons and tassels, or plaited in queus. No unmarried person, male or female, dare wear a hat. The women are clothed with an under garment of rough wool or cotton and a mantle of the same material, which has an aperture on top through which they pass their heads. When 2 1.

002200417	002200417_238	228 MARTIAL LITERATURE. the histories of battles and sieges, have formed a good part of the reading of the mass of the people, and especiaUy of many young persons, during the three past years. The sacred power of poetry has been desecrated to laud the cruel deeds of war. The historian has exhausted upon it aU his research. The fine arts have been employed to pamper the love of war, and by pictures and panoramas, to set on fire the blood of youth with the intoxicating passion of mar- tial achievements. The country is full of these things. Every viUage has its " views " of battles, and the siege at Vera Cruz, or the charge at Buena Vista. The eye of youth is taught to sparkle at the sight of a battle-piece, before it knows what war is. The natural effect upon society of such reading, and war-songs, and exhibitions is exceedingly unfa- vorable to aU the leading moral interests of a free country. It places before the individual a false standard of character, and cheats him into the belief that the best end of Use is to figure in some important scene, to do some great thing, however wrong or bloody, and to disown the quiet pur suits of peace. It places before the nation a wrong standard, and befools the people with the idea that war, and not peace, is their real interest, that they shall gain some valuable end by invading the domains of their neighbors, and conquering a vast extent of barren and unhealthy terri tory. The idea of the true destiny of our country in Uberty, equality and self-government, has by this miasma of war been corrupted into the false idea of our destiny as con sisting in power, military renown, and the vulgar guilt of the savage nations of old, or the unbaptized empires of modern Europe. The news of war, the descriptions of cities taken, of vic tories won, of men killed, are of a poisonous moral influence. They paganize a Christian people. They famiUarize them with carnage and cruelty. They make them forget the sermon on the mount, and the prayer on the cross. They

The passage, as may be seen, resembles in sentiment that of Silius Italicus, of which a translation is given in Note 92 ; only, Claudian thinks that the odds in the strife are more in favour of snow and cold, than fire and flame. 95 'The mal'aria, or bad air, is probably the solstitial disease of the ancient Romans ; a kind of less inveterate yellow fever, usually be ginning in June, and increasing in virulence till aster the first rains in September ; and probably arising from the excess of moisture hastening the production of putrid fermentation in decayed vegetable substances. The effects of this deleterious air have been so accurately observed, that the precise extent of its influence is now tolerably well ascer tained in most parts of the island, and may therefore be avoided by a careful tourist ; especially as the smell and atmospheric density of the miasma assist in detecting it, when it prevails with the greatest in tensity, though it is sometimes also pernicious when the indications of its presence are not perceptible. This subtle vapour acts on the con stitution chiefly in the night, and during sleep, with an effect more fatal to foreigners than to the natives. The patient becomes drowsy and feverish, feels a severe headache, assumes a pallid aspect, and wastes rapidly, until a dropsy terminates a painful existence, or leaves him an invalid for the rest of his life.

Cicero tells us that Romulus, seeking a healthy spot, built his city in a region of pestilence : — " Locum delegit in regioni pestilenti salubrem." Livy shews us how the Roman soldiers, before the invasion of Hannibal, were in the habit of contrasting the sickly and arid Campagna di Roma with the Campagnia Felix of Naples. " An æquum esse dedititios suos ilia fertilitate atque amænitate perrui ; se militando fessos in pestilenti atque arida circa urbem solo luctari." — Lib. VII. The numerous pestilential visitations re corded in Roman history were nothing else than malarious epidemics ren dered contagious, no doubt, by the crowded state of the city, the narrowness of the streets, and the filth of the plebeian population. Take, for example, the dreadful epidemic which scourged Rome for three years, and swept off multitudes of inhabitants, among whom was Camillus, the Dictator. To wards the close of this terrible epidemic, the earth opened in the middle of the forum, doubtless from subterranean fire, which, in all probability, was also the cause of the poisonous miasmata rising from the bowels of the earth. Indeed, the volcanic nature of the Italian peninsula generally may be fairly taken into the list of causes which contribute to its insalubrity. It is very doubtful whether the Campagna was ever so thickly tenanted with living beings as it is represented to have been- Cicero complains, indeed, that the Via Appia was so lined with mausoleums and tombs, from the walls of the city to the vicinity of Alba, that little room was left for habitable mansions. And if villas were scattered in every direction through the Campagna, would that circumstance prove that malaria did not prevail in the months of July and August ? Is it likely that those who could afford to keep a villa in the Campagna, could not also afford to migrate to Tivoli, Alba, Soract£, Baiæ, or other places, beyond the reach of the morbific mias mata, during the two sickly months of the year ? The immense population of Rome and of the Campagna affords no proof of their salubrity. If the insalubrity and mortality of Rome had been ten times greater than they were, the population would have gone on increasing, so long as she remained powerful and prosperous. Gibbon tells us that, in the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, the grave was always dug at the foot of the throne, yet the latter was never without a tenant ! So it was with Rome, and gentleman high in office at Rome assured us that, every year, one in ten of these wretches dies of the fever ; and those who escape carry the marks of the poison in their swoln and sallow countenances. Very few are able totally to throw off the disease ; and repeated exposure to the malaria, in successive seasons, never fails to destroy." Let this be borne in mind by those who spend whole years in Italy.

The population is greater than the appearance of the town would lead one to expect. This is partly owing to the number of free Negroes who herd together in an obscure part of the city, called Little Africa ; and partly to the density of the population round the paper-mills and other manufactories. I believe the number of inhabitants exceeds twenty thousand. We arrived in Cincinnati in February, 1828, and I speak of the town as it was then ; several small churches have been built since, whose towers agreeably relieve its uninteresting mass of buildings. At that time I think Main-street, which is the principal avenue (and runs through the whole town, answering to the High-street of our old cities), was the only one entirely paved. The troittoir is of brick, tolerably well laid, but it is inundated by every shower, as Cincinnati has no drains whatever. What makes this omission the more remarkable is, that the situation of the place is calculated both to facilitate their construction and to render them necessary. Cincin nati is built on the side of a hill that begins to rise at the river's edge, and were it furnished with drains of the sim plest arrangement, the heavy showers ofthe climate would keep them constantly clean ; as it is, these showers wash the higher streets, only to deposite their filth in the first level spot ; and this happens to be in the street second in importance to Main-street, running at right angles to it, and containing most of the large warehouses of the town. This deposite is a dreadful nuisance, and must be produc tive of miasma during the hot weather. The town is built, as I believe most American towns are, in squares, as they call them ; but these squares are the reverse of ours, being solid instead of hollow. Each consists, or is intended to consist, when the plan of the city is completed, of a block of buildings fronting north, east, west, and south ; each house communicating with an alley, furnishing a back entrance. This plan would not be a bad one were the town properly drained, but as it is, these alleys are horrible abominations, and must, I con ceive, become worse with every passing year. To the north, Cincinnati is bounded by a range of forest covered hills, sufficiently steep and rugged to prevent their

A. J. Galloway, Esq., of Ewington, Effingham County, says: "There is little disease at any time in the State, which may not be traced directly or indirectly, to derangement in the biliary organs, and much of this should no doubt be attributed to the free use of heavy bread, strong coffee, a large amount of animal food, and the partial or total exclusion of vegetable diet. I think I am free from prejudice when I say that, except in the valleys of the larger streams, but more especially upon tbe high, rolling prairies of middle and Northern Illi nois, a more healthy country is not to be found, even in the moun tainous districts of the older States." L. G. Chase, Esq., of Massachusetts, who travelled for several months through Illinois, writes, in a letter dated Pera, Dec. 22, 1855, as follows : " So far as health is concerned, time will prove that tbe prairies of the West will compare well with any of the Eastern States. Eastern people have made a great bugbear of the miasma of the prairies ; but if they will turn their attention to the thousands of alder swamps be tween their hills, where the sun and wind are almost strangers, they will discover more causes of ill-health concentrated there in a few acres, than is scattered over a whole prairie, where the purifying in fluences of the sun and wind have full scope. This season has been an unusual unhealthy one for this State, but during the most sickly time, I was wandering over the prairies, and saw but few instances where the ill-health could not be directly traced to infringements of physical laws, either through ignorance or necessity. In some cases of chills and fever that have come under my observation, a few out ward applications of soap and water no doubt would have relieved the patient. Then again, if the pioneers would eat less pork, and more fruit and vegetables, it would be much better for them ; and I only wonder, all things considered, that there is so much health here, where the people are such great sinners in a physical point of view. Pure water is an important item in the bill of health, though it is but little attended to. People all over the prairies drink surface-water, when 23
001396322	001396322_269	266 STATE OF HEALTH AND DISEASES. by digging or boring, pure water can be had, or what might be still better for family use, cisterns can be sunk in the earth at a trifling expense, to save all of the rain-water from buildings. When the new settlers get the conveniences of life around them, the prairies will be regarded as more healthy than the Eastern States. " The fevers of the West will never be a match for the consumption of the East." In a letter written by Joseph C. Orth, Esq., of McCleary's Bluff, Wabash County, we find the following : " As to health, I honestly believe Southern Illinois will compare favorably with any portion of the West. That scourge of the north, consumption, is almost unknown here. On the rich lowlands, border ing the streams, bilious disorders prevail to some extent, in the fall, but on the upland, good health may be enjoyed, with ordinary pru dence. Diseases, the result of miasma, prevail in every new country south of the 44th parallel of latitude, when the virgin soil is first turned over and exposed to the atmosphere. It was so in the Genesee Valley, in New York, and in the Valley of the Miami, in Ohio; and it has been so in Illinois; but the country becomes more healthful as it grows older. A great deal of ague and fever is attributable to er rors in diet, to imprudent exposures, to uncomfortable dwellings, and to the use of well-water where it leaks through the soil, instead of flowing through veins in the rock. By occupying comfortable tene ments, avoiding needless exposure, eating suitable food, and using only sweet, pure, cistern water, for drinking and culinary purposes, as good health may be enjoyed in Southern Illinois as any where in the Union." Lastly, Edward Harkness, Esq., of Southport, a resident in Peoria County, for twenty years, communicates the following : " Those who have been induced to believe that Illinois is a very uuhealthy country, would do well to examine the census-tables of 1850, and compare the bills of mortality with those in the States reputed to be healthy. I have not now those tables at hand, but well remember that the deaths for one year previous to June, 1850, was a less ratio in Illinois than in Massachusetts, and was considerably below the ge neral average in the United States. The facts and figures of the cen sus ought forever to stop the babblings of interested parties, who wish

Although fever, dysentery, diarrhœa, and ague are rife, deaths are not numerous. There is plenty of hos pital-room, and the surgeons can hold every case well in hand. Precautions also are multiplied with a praiseworthy minuteness. Every sentry has sherry and bitters given him to fortify his stomach against the night miasma ; the ships are alternately moved down to the healthy islands at the Bogue ; and the expulsion of our old friend, the Mandarin of Chuenpee, was because his fort was wanted for sanitary purposes. The few officers and civilians who are daring enough to go out in the sun, try to escape from themselves by a voyage round the island, or a trip to Macao. I have accomplished both these achievements. The voyage round the island was performed in a private pleasure-steamer, and, notwithstand ing the presence of a well-filled refrigerator, was the hottest thing I ever did in my life. Stanley, at the back of the island, is a native village and an English barrack. It stands upon a pretty isthmus, with the Chinese Sea breathing its south-west monsoon into its face, and a tranquil, landlocked bay rippling against its feet. They say that bay is not large enough or deep enough for the fleet of merchantmen the China trade employs. It is now used as a bathing-place for the troops, as the shelter of small fishing-craft, and as a resource of very hungry pirates, who at night or early dawn have sometimes dashed into the bay and attempted to carry off fishing-boats under the eyes of the garrison. It is a voyage of forty mdes round this little island. It is scarcely more to Macao, and, although the fate of the Thistle and the Queen has rendered the perils of that passage more notorious, I doubt whether there are more pirates lurking in the archipelago between Victoria and Macao than in the islets at the back of Hongkong. While we gaily steamed along in our little toy steamer several times did some vicious-looking junks stand down towards us, their large mat-sails looking like the wings of a bird of prey, and heavy cannon frowning mischief from their desk But they always stood off again when they found

Often these dens are chokingly full of denizens — often some are empty, because thed former inhabitants haA-e migrated to prison. Anderson-roAV is mainly a nursery for young criminals, and these dozen houses, on an average, supply three-fourths of the contingent to the prisons and re formatories. Women, trembling Avith frost and hunger, duty and half naked, stood in the doonvays, or lay on the stones under the houses. I had seen in the mud hovels of the heath what Leland had to offer in' the shape of want and misery, where human beings and animals pass the night under one straw roof, often on one straw bed.

Not to behold it, as in Aggas's plan, nearly surrounded by houses, and its eastern portion covered by a stately building and precincts, in use within a few years past, as one of the most important of the city monasteries, but to see it as Smithfield was in the early part of the twelfth century. It was then the western and firmer portion of that great morass which extended as far east as Bishopsgate, and north to the high ground of Ishngton. Though intersected by more than one brook, abounding in springs, and possessing a pool so large, that Stow, nearly four centuries afterwards, calls it a " great water," there were portions raised above the level of the bog, as William Fitzstephen, who wrote in this twelfth century our earhest account of London, calls it, " a certain smooth-field — campus planus — immediately in the suburb," and mentions, further, that it was even then used for the purposes of a noted show of well-bred cattle held every Friday, unless such were a solemn festival From this use, probably, arose its name Smith field, or the field of smiths, as numerous small forges for shoeing horses were scattered round it at an early date. Except on the occasion of these shows, it must have been a wild and solitary spot, and one of hi repute ; for here, beside a cluster of elm trees, a probable remnant of the primeval forest, the citizens had from time immemorial set theh public gallows. It was on this, respectively in 1305 and 1330, that Wallace and Roger Mortimer were hanged. Vet on this waste, shut out from the cheerful dweUings of men by the city walls, and open to the miasmas of the great fen, Christianity set up her divine ark, as in countless other places of desolation and evil name. One Rahere, or Raherus, a Norman by bis name, after passhig the flower of his youth amidst the licentiousness of the soldier's camp and the feudal castle, for he was minstrel to King Henry I., was "penytant of hys synnes." That it is to say, from purely physical causes the mind rose superior to low tastes and sensual inclinations, as in similar cases of men of strong intellect and fine imaginative powers. Had he lived in the seven teenth century, instead of the twelfth, he might have imagined " the mountains of the shining ones," given proof of consummate statesmanship, or believed that neither church nor priest ie necessary when man desires to hold pure and reverent coni-

It possessed a "great barn, a gatehouse, stables, a court, and orchard," * and was the property of the prebends of Halliwell and Finsbury, in the Cathedral of St. Paul's. Whether let or tenanted by themselves, there is no evidence. Near at hand were the beautiful fields of " Iseldon and Hoxton," the celebrated well or spring of St. Agnes le Clair, and " Peerless Pool," or as it was called in the time of Stow, " PeriUous Pond," on account of many drowned therein whdst bathing. It was fed by a spring originally of great volume, " that overflowing its banks, caused a dangerous pond." t The spring stiU exists as a bath in Old Street Road. Notwithstanding these various efforts to improve the great fen, it remained, in part, at least, but an indifferent place tiU 1606, when it was finally drained, and that portion of it which became in 1622 the New Artillery Ground, was planted with trees, the grass raded in to keep it from being trodden down, and pleasant walks formed across and around it. These improvements cost the City of London 5,000£ From this latter date, therefore, suburban houses were built here and there, though it was not tdl the latter end of the reign of Charles II. that any signs of modern Finsbury arose. At that date, about the period of the death of Milton, it began to be rapidly buUt over. The Plague of 1665 raged, as we have seen, more fearfuUy in Cripplegate than elsewhere. It began there with the first outbreak of the pestilence, and only ceased at its close. There were reasons enough, we think, for this. The miasma of the great fen stdl lingered there, and does in a degree to this day. Any intelhgent person, or one at aU acquainted with a fen country, could at once tell, if passing through Finsbury Square or the City Road, that both had been built over a morass ; the atmosphere is so totally unlike that of aU other parts of London. We have constantly observed this. At the time of the Great Plague, therefore, matters must have been much worse, as many open ditches, and other nuisances complained of by Stow, still undoubtedly remained. The inhabitants of Cripplegate thus dying by hundreds, the ordinary churchyards were soon filled, and it was found necessary to form a common receptacle for the dead. A spot was therefore chosen to the north of the ArtUlery Ground, and a huge pit dug, known as the Finsbury Pit. It was this probably that Pepys, whose curiosity was astounding, went to see, under the date of August 30th, 1665. "I went forth and walked to Moorfields, to see (God forgive my presumption) whether I could see any dead corpse going to the grave, but, as God would have it, did not. But, Lord, how everybody looks and discourses in the street of death, and nothing else ; and few people going up and down, that the town is like a place distressed and forsaken." It was of this pit, "then lying open to the fields," that De Foe teUs the * Strype's Stow, b. iv. p. 101. f Cunningham, p. 389.

Not alone books, but choice prints, colour drawino-s, and sketches by famous men of the brush, with select tables for precious stones, and bits of marble and intaglios, and bits of statues, and antiques in general ; in short, a rude sort of art bazaar held here under the sky. Then, for a change, you may turn to the hardware depart- ment, and select anything, from rusty naUs and bolts, ranged symmetricaUy, to an anchor — Heaven knows how it got there ! You can recreate yourself with choice fruits and vegetables, ancl every ecUble, choice being only too distracting. By the curious market code that pre- vails, you may have the wing of a chicken or the leg of a hare cut off and sent home, or, indeed, any special limb you may fancy, and purchasers are nice in selecting their particular limb, as tfiougfi it were a joint. Here you see ranks of suspicious httle birds, which I fear me much are innocent robins, sparrows, and such fry, our sportsman not discriminating too exactly as to the quality of his game ; and here I see a vUlanous-looking savage busy plucking the feathers from a wretched f owi, who is strug gling and flapping between his legs. A fragrance scarcely aromatic attends me in all this progress. I fear our Holy City has powerful claims to be ranked among savoury capitals.

As tfie Dutcb capital is individualised in its own particular effluvia, wfiich makes the heart sick unto death, so here is found a delicate aroma, quite sui generis, and defying analysis, from which the voyager flies, his cloak streaming behind him ; but miasma rides beside him, like the horseman Atra Cura.

Curiously opportune and grimly appropriate to this vein of thought, comes swinging round the corner the heavy lumbering railway omnibus, mountainous with baggage, crowded with travellers and blue familiars of the institu tion hanging out from inconceivable places. Ancl I re collect how, years ago, when there was a fierce plague at work, these very public carriages bore a shape sfightly altered, and trundled daily out at the city gates with a horrid complement of corpse passengers inside. These two or three vehicles, which so often run jingling by, do indeed suggest the hearse, and were hearses once — so the legend runs — giant dead-carts. Burgher Romanus — eminently practical in his views — when the plague time passed over, had these carriages on his hands, and, adapt ing himself happily to the spirit of the times, made alteration in cushioning and interior economy, and thus utilised his mortuary vehicles. It is a dismal proof of that reckless demorahsation which hangs by the skirts of ravaging plague and pestilence, that this diurnal sortie and re-entry of the omnibus dead cart was ingeniously perverted to wholesale smuggling purposes : contraband wares being concealed under the heaps of lnortaHty. No wonder that customs officers at the gates, shrinking back from search, should bid the black wain go on its way un visited. And yet it is precisely about this unwdiolesome season that our noble ladies of quality are wont to break their boudoir sheUs, and flutter forth, in state, upon the public places.

If the visitor is not by this time tired of Hampton Court, he can wal the green, or stroll round the outskirts of the village. He will find it, either in its still life, or in the bustle of its activity, food for contemplation. A Richmond omnibus (a white one) draws up to our inn, and we take our place to Twickenham. A beautiful drive it is across the park. The long avenue of chestnuts in full bloom, with the graceful deer shading themselves under their spreading branches — it does one good to breathe the pure air, and enjoy the serenity of a fine summer's day through a scene like this. The coachman and conductor both look rosy with health, and the very horses appear by their lively pace to enjoy their run through the park. We drive out at the far end of this long avenue, and are in Teddington-lane, and presently at the village itself. It is a pretty straggling village, with nothing particular to recommend it, if we except its salubrity aud its rusticity — two very great recommendations in our estimation. The church, which we pass on our road to Twickenham, is situated very prettily, and its ivy mantled tower smiles upon and o'ershadows many a peaceful grave. Some little distance forward on our left lies Strawberry Hill, once the residence of the celebrated Horace Walpole. Beyond this on the right, before we epte-r Twickenham, is Pope's villa, a strange and curious-looking building. in the Chinese style of architecture. This spot is rich in historical and poetical remembrances. It was here the immortal Pope wrote most of his sublime essays. The genius of poetry seems to us to hover over the place now, and we never pass it without thinking of the extraordinary poetical talent of him who could imagine and pen that masterly production of mind, " Pope's Essay on Man." We have arrived at Twickenham, and are pursuing our way to Richmond Bridge, and shall never lose sight of old Father Tham< he seems determined to appear in every change of landscape, and he is quite welcome to do so. We have always a friendly greeting for hitn, for he has carried us safely hundreds of times on his glittering bosom, and afforded us many a day's sport. Poor Father Thames ! no wonder he is angry sometimes, and swallows a few unfortunate persons, for he is con tinually being ploughed by boats, steamers, and barges, till his bosom resembles a newly-ploughed fallow. He has yet another grievance, and i3 compelled to swallow the dregs and drains of all the towns and villages through which he passes. This is the most disgusting to him, but he has his revenge in the summer time. In colleague with the sun, he sends forth a few fatal miasmas to breed fever and disease among his tormentors.

All the boats are sculled by a large oar over the stem, rigged in an iron socket. This gives them the advantage of moving in a crowd, where there is not room to work oars. All the junks have an eye painted on each bow ; the Chinamen say, " Spose no have eye, no can see." The factories are the largest and best buildings in the suburbs of Canton. The great mass of the houses are no bet ter than so many sheds and barns, when compared to the beau tiful and costly houses in the principal cities of the American Union. There is a great deal of " gingerbread-work" about Canton, which savours strongly of lanterns, masks, colours, squibs, and gongs, all national peculiarities. It is not my intention to swell the size of this book by en tering into an historical description of the Empire of China, nor to express my views of the late British invasion. In this work I have confined myself to a few of the immediate incidents that came under my personal observation. Discussions of public events may be readily found in other works. The European merchants resident at Canton are like so many birds confined in a cage ; they are at the mercy of the Chinese, so far as relates to food, drink, and servants, and can not have lawful wives. There is a deep-rooted prejudice among the Chinese in favour of " old customs," and no great change can be effected suddenly, except at the point of the sword. From infancy they are taught to look upon a for eigner as a being inferior to a native of the Celestial Empire. They profess to respect Europeans, in order to get from them the " almighty dollar." The Emperor of China fears the power of Europeans, and hence he interdicts their women and mis sionaries, and endeavours to keep alive the prejudices of his subjects against all "barbarians." He knows that if they once gain a foothold in the country, and become the owners of property, the prejudices of his people will gradually wear away and his power will be overthrown. It was very sickly at Whampoa during our stay. Most of the sailors on board the ships were sick with colds and fevers, occasioned by the malign miasma that rises from the paddy fields after sunset, and by drinking too much shamsoo.

Some palms fid a jar in one night, holding about six pints. It is sweetened with honey, and drunk as soon as made; and its flavour and effect are very much like new wine, with the flavour of cyder. The heart of the palm tree is also cut out and eaten. But this, like the process of making the wine, spoils the tree. The people of the Nile, therefore, never taste the former unless a tree faUs, as they cannot afford to sacrifice what costs them an annual duty. The trees of the Oasis are taxed in mass, those of the Nde singly ; and whether dead or living, have the privilege of paying a fixed tax. They also make treacle from the dates ; and they lay up dried pomegranates for the winter and spring. The liquorice roots (soos) are sent to the Nde in baskets, sold at from three to six piastres a-piece, and are used for making a sort of sherbet. The principal gardens are about el Kasr, where fruit trees are abundant, particularly apricots, pomegranates, Seville oranges (naring * ) , and vines : they have also the banana, the Nebk], the mokhaytX, olive, peach, fig, pear, and some others, among which I was surprised to find one plum, and two or three apple trees. Olives are not abundant; and they are mostly brought from the Siwah and Farafreh. Though the inhabitants of the Oasis are a much less indus trious and energetic race than the fellahs of Egypt, they pay considerable attention to the cultivation of their lands ; but they have not to undergo the same tod in raising water as on the Nde, the streams that constantly flow from plentiful springs affording a convenient and never-failing supply for irrigation. But the stagnant lakes created by the surplus of water exhale a pernicious miasma, causing a dangerous remit tent fever, which annuaUy rages in the summer and autumn ; and the Arabs of the desert consider it unsafe to visit these districts, at any other season than the winter.

The and diffusion of fever and human miasma. " They are," as Dr. Howard remarks of little Ireland, " most improvident and dis- solute in their habits, regardless alike of order, cleanliness, aud comfort, a circumstance which in some degree accounts for its (Little Ireland) disgraceful and dirty condition, for it is always observable that those quarters where the Irish congregate are the worst in this respect." The total number of Irish in Man- chester is 34,304; and as there is but a very small proportion of Irish Protestants in the town, we shall not be far wrong in estimating the Irish Catholic population at about 30,000. Though located in the very centre of industry, they retain with great tenacity, their national peculiarities. Forethought, comfort, and economy, are things they have little or no idea of; and they bear with resignation a large amount of physical suffering, which a little prudence and energy, would easily prevent. Their diet is of the lowest description, and consists of potatoes, oatmeal, butter- milk, and sometimes bacon. Indolence of disposition, and instability of character, prevent them from aspiring to a higher standard of living, and their great numbers have produced a competition with the English labourer, which has taught him how to live upon a lower scale of diet, and of household comfort, than he was wont to do. Although not destitute of natural talent, they do not possess the secret of making it available for the purposes of life ; and the rate of wages for unskilled labour (although higher in a large town like Manchester than elsewhere) is yet so low as to require almost con- stant labour to secure a living, even upon their low standard. Thus, although indolent in their temperament, they are, from necessity, hardworking ; but their labour is of the lowest description ; and but few Irish Catholics are to be found in the ranks of skilled labourers. As in America, so in England, they are the hewers of wood and drawers of water ; and like the Israelites in Egypt, the more miser- able their condition, the faster do they multiply. A sufficient induce- ment, surely, for society to take active measures to remedy an evil which diffuses itself in proportion to its intensity. What is true of the poorer Irish Catholics, applies also, though in a modified degree, to the wealthier amongst them ; for although their general habits prevent many from rising above tbe lowest grade of society, yet, tbe few who do so are remarkable neither for intelligence or energy.

The civil hospital is small and crowded to excess. The prin cipal diseases now are intermittent fevers, caught from the miasma of the plains. They are of all types — quotidian, tertian, and quatertian, and sometimes what is called a pernicious or irregular rigour will carry off the patient suddenly. It is remarkable, that although some get well for the time being, and health seems perfectly restored, yet are they liable to relapses again and again, often after an interval of several months, and that without any fresh exposure to infection. Diarrhœas, anasarca, subacute dropsies, and enormous enlargement of the spleen, are the usual sequents of this disease, which is the principal epidemic of the country, and by which the French have lost great numbers, especially on the out-stations. The treatment consists in quinine, given in exceedingly large doses, even to twenty grains ; and at times this has the effect of completely cutting short the malady. Continued fevers are fortunately of rare occurrence, and I did not see four cases of ophthalmia, although its effects are every where visible among the native inhabitants ; but affections of the skin are very general. Inoculation has been long practised by the natives.* The military hospital is an immense establishment, and beau tifully situated in the former garden of the Dey, about a mile from the town, near the sea. It was admirably clean, airy, and well regulated, and has around it the finest orange groves in this neighbourhood. A portion is set apart for the officers. The Sisters of Charity act as nurses, and are highly serviceable among the sick. Besides the numbers here suffering under the wounds and operations resulting from the late attack on Con stantina, were many labouring under the fever of the plain. On my way to it the road led from the Bab-el-Ouetta gate, through * Some diseases have been introduced by the French, which were almost unknown before ; when these did occur, they were of mild character, and the natives treated them on the purest antiphlogistic system, keeping the patients on raisins and water for thirty days.

The little band of dragoons are encamped by a fine spring of cool water, within half a mile of the principal town of the Camanchees, and in the midst of a bustling and wild scene, I assure you ; and before I proceed to give an account of things and scenes that a*-e about me, I must return for a few moments to the place where I left the Reader, at the encampment at False Washita, and rapidly travel with him over the country that lies between that place and the Camanchee Village, where I am now writing. On the morning after my last Letter was written, the sound and efficient part of the regiment was in motion at nine o'clock. And with them, my friend " Joe" and I, with our provisions laid in, and all snugly arranged on our packhorse, which we alternately led or drove between us. Our course was about due West, on the divide between the Washita and Red Rivers, with our faces looking towards the Rocky Mountains. The country over which we passed from day to day, was inimitably beautiful ; being the whole way one continuous prairie of green fields, with occasional clusters of timber and shrubbery, just enough for the uses of cultivating-man, and for the pleasure of his eyes to dwell upon. The regiment was rather more than half on the move, consisting of 250 men, instead of 200 as I pre dicted in my Letter from that place. All seemed gay and buoyant at the fresh start, which all trusted was to liberate us from the fatal miasma which we conceived was hovering about the mouth of the False Washita. We advanced on happily, and met with no trouble until the second night of our encampment, in the midst of which we were thrown into " pie" (as printers would say,) in an instant of the most appalling alarm and confusion. We were encamped on a beautiful prairie, where we were every hour apprehen sive of the lurking enemy. Aud in the dead of night, when all seemed to be sound asleep and quiet, the instant sound and flash of a gun within a few paces of us ! and then the most horrid and frightful groans that instantly followed it, broughi us all upon our hands and knees in an instant, and our affrighted horses (which were breaking their lasos,) in full speed and fury over our heads, with the frightful and mingled din of snorting, and cries of "Indians! Indians! Pawnees!" &c, which rang from every part of our

The air is indeed moist, but it is, at the same time, par ticularly pure, to which the tide-streams, running in all directons round nine-tenths of its boundary, must in no small degree con tribute. It is vitiated by no miasma : the beaches are generally gravelly and bold ; and though a considerable part of the surface of the parish consists of marshy grounds, these lie along the sum mit of the ridge, and none of their exhalations at any season de scend to the cultivated and inhabited districts. It is very seldom that any thing like foggy weather prevails ; and the haars of the east coast are entirely unknown. It ought to be mentioned, how ever, that one part is certainly less healthy than the rest : that toward the south, which is much crowded by plantations, and where, during the last twenty years, the proportion of sickness and death has been much greater than in the Loch Long district, and on the upper shores of the Gareloch. The prevalent diseases are rheumatic and pnlmonary affections, which may be accounted for by the humidity of the climate, the nature and situation of the dwellings. Fevers do not frequently occur, and when they do, are traceable in almost all cases to infection from without the isle, as it is called, and are convey ed sometimes under circumstances that reflect but little credit on the principles and feelings of the wealthier classes of our city The transmission of sound acrossthe Ferry is remarkably varied by the degreeof hu midity in the air ; but no state of the atmosphere for the last twenty years has enabled the writer to detect the celebrated echo of the district. It is, however, gravely stated as a fact in acoustic treatises, on the authority of Dr Bird, " that, somewhere in the * isle,' when a person at a proper distance played eight or ten notes on a trumpet, they were correctly repeated, but a third lower ; after a short silence another repetition was heard in a yet lower tone ; and after another short interval they were repeated a third time lower still." That proper distance nobody has been able to discover, ot least within the last twenty years. It is possible the reverberation may have been greatly modified by the growth of the plantations ; but it is not likely that these varying keys should have been altogether lost. It is a curious circumstance, that, many years ago, when hailing a steam-boat at anchor in the contiguous bay from the point of Craigencroan, the words were repeated distinctly ; and finding, on trial, that we had caught an echo of nine syllables, the writer and his friend at first supposed it was the long lost echo re stored to the vicinage. There was no such repetition, no pause, nor change of key ; but from that day to this the echo none can rouse from her slumber. A most evanescent creature she must have been, in all probability depending for her existence on the position of the steamer at the time annihilated by the first dash of her paddle. So much for the Roseneath echo. Philosophers, puzzling themselves to explain the mystery of her being, may remind one of Charles the Second, with his fish and tub of water, among the fathers of the Royal Society. 4

" Mississippi City. — The location of this great future seaport of Mississippi, and of the south-west at large, is so commanding, that it will ever be a matter of surprise that it was hot sooner appropriated to the uses for which it was designed by the muni ficent hand of Nature. Neither New Orleans, Mobile, Pensacola, or Charleston, can hold competition with the vast natural advan tages of Mississippi City, as a seaport of the first magnitude. The harbour-surveyors pronounce the capacity and safety ofthe anchor age lo equal, if not surpass, that of any other harbour in the United States. Its freedom from either ice or rock bound shores — its protection from winds by the south-western neck of main land, and Cat, Ship, and other islands — its noble passes between Cat Island and the main land, Avith twenty-seven feet of water, and between Cat and Ship islands, with thirty-three feet of water, and with forty to forty-three feet of water inside — its good mud bottom — all combine to render it a safe and magnificent roadstead, Avhere ships of the largest class can ride, sheltered and safe, within a mile of the shore. Indeed, those excellent judges of naval posi tions, the British, anchored their fleet in this harbour during the invasion of New Orleans in the late war. The only possible approach of storms from the south-east is guarded by a chain of islands. The Avater in the offing gradually shallows from the Gulf to the island-passes, Arhere there is from twenty-seven to forty three feet to come in Avith. " The site presents a bold, firm, and dry front, from Pass Christian to the bay of Biloxi. There are no marshes nor low grounds in the rear, and it is far enough removed from the Pearl river swamps on the west, and those of Pascagoula on the east, to be entirely free of musquitoes and miasmas from these sources. Instead of being under the necessity of retreating from this site, to find a healthful summer residence, the reverse would be the case. This coast is now the Arcadia of the south-west — the refuge of the interior, and of the delta, from summer and autumnal fevers. The luxurious and inexhaustible oyster-beds, the almost endless variety of fish in the sea, and the abundance of Avild-fow
000262641	000262641_101	The annexed view, taken from the summit of the Shoedong Hill, (a lofty eminence overlooking the town of Arracan,) represents a sort of bird's-eye view of that place, the lines and temporary barracks of the troops composing the south-east division of the army in 1825, and the plain extending to the Colandine river ; of the wild and woody appearance of which it does not, however, give a sufficiently accurate idea, owing to the rather imperfect state of the sketch from which it was taken. A short description of this remote and pestilential town, which during the Birman war proved the grave of so many brave men, has already been given in the Third Number of these Views ; and the writer is not aware that he can, on the present occasion, add any thing to that description which would interest the reader. The general unhealthiness of the province arises almost entirely from the undrained -and ill-cultivated state of the plains ; as also from the extensive forests with which at least three-fourths of the countiy are covered. These, by the decay of their rank vegetation, not only engender malaria, but by their extreme density prevent the free circulation of the sea breezes, which would otherwise in some measure disperse it. On the coast, where the country is at all open, the climate in general seems much more congenial to the European constitution than that of Bengal ; if we may judge by the appearance of those few English officers who are condemned to hve for a season in this inhospitable land. Nevertheless, life is here more precarious, for particular winds occasionally wast to them the pestiferous miasma of the woods ; and persons who may for a long time have enjoyed uninterrupted good health, fall sudden victims to the malignant fevers which it generates ; or if they chance to survive, the constitution receives a shock from which it rarely recovers. The European here seems to stand on a sort of debateable land, which divides, as it were, the em pires of health and disease, — represented respectively by the ocean breezes, and the corrupted atmosphere of the interior, — and these antagonist powers appear to struggle for his possession, as the rival principles ofthe Manichæans are supposed to contend for the immaterial man. Arracan, up to the period when the writer quitted it, had proved, in a fiscal point of view, an unprofitable possession to the British government ; costing far more to protect and govern than the amount of its scanty revenues. An improved system of taxation ; the suppression of dacoity, or river piracy, which prevailed to a frightful extent ; and the establishment of an efficient police, to protect from dacoits and mountain marauders the remote circles and villages, might in the course of twenty years, by encouraging settlers from the neighbouring countries, raise it into a valuable possession. The soil is- very fertile ; calculated to yield in perfection, rice, indigo, sugar, and other tropical productions. The country is also of importance as a good medium of communication between British traders and the inhabitants of Ava Proper, with which country ithe natives of Arracan cany on a mercantile communication by means of the Aeng road and other passes over the mountains.

United States, has investigated fully the influence of our southern climates on our population, and uses the following decided language in relation to the whites : "In these localities, as is often observed in the tide-water region of our Southern States, the human frame is weakly constituted, or imperfectly developed : the mortality among children is very great, and the mean duration of life is comparatively short. Along the frontiers of Florida and the southern borders of Georgia, as witnessed by the author, as well as in the low lands of the Southern States generally, may be seen deplorable examples of the physical, and perhaps mental, deterioration induced by endemic influences. In earliest infancy, the complexion becomes sallow, and the eye assumes a bilious tint : advancing towards the years of maturity, the growth is arrested, the limbs become atte nuated, the viscera engorged, &c." — P. 365. But, leaving our own country, let us look abroad and see what the history of other nations teaches. The best-authenticated examples, perhaps, anywhere to be found on record, of the enduring influence of marsh malaria on a race, are in the Campagna, Maremma, Pontines, and other insalubrious locali ties iu classic Italy. Tbe following account is given by Dr. James Johnson, in his work on Change of Air; and every traveller through Italy can vouch for its fidelity : "It is from the mountain of Viterbo that we have the first glimpse of the wide-spread Campagna di Roma. The beautiful little lake of Vico lies under our feet, its sloping banks cultivated like a garden, but destitute of habitations, on account of the deadly malaria, which no culture can annihilate. From this spot, till we reach the desert, the features of poverty and wretchedness in the inhabitants themselves, as well as in everything around them, grow rapidly more marked. We descend from Monti Rose upon the Campagna, and, at Baccano, we are in the midst of it." After describing the beauty of tbe scenery, and its luxuriaut vegetation, be continues : " But no human form meets the eye, except the gaunt figure of the herdsman, muffled up to the chin in his dark mantle, with his gun and his spear ; his broad hat slouched over the ferocious and scowling countenance of a brigand : the buffalo which he guards is less repugnant than he. As for the shepherd, Arcadia forbid that I should attempt his descrip tion! The savage of the wigwam has health to recommend him. As we approach within ten miles of Rome, some specks of cultivation appear, and with them the dire effects of malaria on the human frame. Bloated bellies, distorted features, dark yellow complexions, livid eyes and lips; in short, all the symptoms of dropsy, jaundice, and ague, united in their persons. That this deleterious miasma did exist in the Campagna from the very first foundation of Rome down to the present moment, there can be little doubt." He then goes on to prove the fact, from the writings of Cicero, Livy, and others ; and makes it clear that tbe population of Italy are no nearer being acclimated against tbis poison, than they were two thousand years ago. Sir James Johnson makes the following just remarks, which apply equally to the malarious districts of our country :

The mahogany vessel returning from the pestiferous lowlands of the Spanish Main, her crew often pallid with disease, and bearing appalling accounts of the climate they had left, were enough to influence the mind of even the hardiest adventurer, while the fate of the few attempts to colonize with European settlers seemed to point out the coast as a Golgotha for all for- eigners venturesome enough to make it even a temporary place of residence. Of the interior, little or nothing wslS known ex- cept that it was a " tropical climate" — quite sufficient to make the trader reflect long and earnestly before visiting its shores, and the mariner to turn with a shudder from the proposed voy- age. The advance of civilization is fast placing Central Amer- ica in glowing prominence before the world. Old and fabulous ideas respecting its people and climate are giving way before the research of the nervous Anglo-Saxon race. Tales of its poisonous miasma ; its inviting exterior, concealing savage beasts of prey and venomous reptiles; its dark jungles, the birth-place of malaria, and its luxuriant foliage, exhaling the vapors of dis- ease and death — these have passed away as idle dreams, and no longer deter the march of the adventurer. The natural re sources of the country, equaling in variety and excelling in quantity those of the coveted Cuba, added to its proximity to the United States, can not but eventually bring it into closer intimacy with the spirit of commercial enterprise characterizing the day. Our ariero was a Jamaican, whose occupation was to furnish mules to the Transit Company at a stipulated price per head. He was said to be the owner of above a hundred animals, em ploying a large number of natives, and I was assured by a ne gro who walked beside my mule that it was no small honor to he nttended in person by the " patron."

There was my goal ; for that region I had left California ; and though it was all-important to await the arrival of Don Carlos, yet the time seemed thrown away until I could reach at least Tegucigalpa, of whose fame I heard such accounts that I longed, as the countryman pines for his first glimpse of the shire town, to view this city of the mountains, the very name of which, until shortly before, I had never heard. At last a boat from the em barcaclero of Choluteca made its appearance, and, casting anchor off the little town, its living freight was quickly landed, consist ing of Senor Dardano and three daughters. Their journey had been an arduous and perilous one. Leaving New Orleans, they had been twenty-two days under sail to Omoa, on the Carib bean Sea, whence they had traveled by mule conveyance, via Comayagua and Tegucigalpa, across the continent. I was agreeably surprised to find three young ladies with the graces and accomplishments attendant upon a New York education, and conversing fluently in English, as well as in French, Ital ian, and Spanish. As soon as the fatigues of the journey had been met by the required repose, and the usual formal introduc tions gone through with, I presented my letters, and soon came to an understanding with my host. On the following morning the island was in an uproar. The commandante of Amapala hoisted the national flag, and threw open his little grog-shop, of which business he has the monopo ly in Tigre Island, and pays the supreme government thirty dol lars per month for the license. A salute was fired from the door of the cuartel, and the Sardinian flag hoisted over the con sular residence of Don Carlos. Old and young turned out, and flocked to the residence of the new-comers to offer congratula tions and hear the news from the interior. A bullock, which had been tied to the sacrificial stake for a week past, awaiting the arrival of the party, was killed and distributed among the friends of the family, and by night the little town was in fine condition to sing or shout, as the case might be, the praises of Don Car los. Fireworks and vivas, salvos of artillery and the popping of champagne corks, the twanging of guitars, and the merry con- K

The difference between the tierras calientes of the Mosquito coast and the cool table lands of all interior Honduras is the most remarkable fact forc- ing itself upon the foreigner. Toward midnight we approached the village of Guaymaca, situated in the valley of that name. The storm still swept the ravines as we descended. Removed from the ordinary routes of travel, these mountain villages present pictures of extreme poverty, unrelieved by any communication with the outer little world of Honduras, itself a hermit's cell compared with the other Central American states. I have endeavored to depict the condition of these settlements in the few already described, that the future traveler, if such there should ever be in these parts, may form some idea of the entertainment he is likely to meet with. You encounter them at long intervals, with each eight or ten leagues of intermediate desolation. The villagers seem to have nothing to eat, or, if they have, it is so little that they are loth to share or sell it. A few tortil las, a flock of lean fowls, perhaps an attenuated porker, consti tute the only visible means of subsistence for each famdy. Let the reader picture a barren mountain path winding among such scenery as has already been described. It is in the dry season : a cold night wind whistles through the scanty herbage, carrying clouds of dust, and half sweeping you from your saddle. You have fasted since daylight, and a mind predisposed to despond ency by weariness and hunger, for a long time silently endured, is excited to ill-defined but sad forebodings. Suddenly the dis tant bark of a dog arouses your sensitive mules. They quicken their pace, and slide rapidly down the steep declivities. If it be in the wet season, you are probably saturated with rain, and blinded with the incessant lightning flashes, almost searing your eye-balls with their intensity. Soon you are advancing upon a level ground, and in the middle of a small plain, an eighth of a mile wide, may be seen the outline of some Indian huts. A troop of savage curs rushes out, and your advance is announced by a grand chorus of pigs, mules, horses, and feath ered choristers, but as yet no sign or voice of humanity ; no lights in the village ; all dark, silent, and asleep.

The atmosphere is heated mainly by its lower portion's coming in contact with tho heated surface of the earth ; as it acquires heat, it becomes lighter and more elastic, and mounts upward, and its place is supplied by a rush of colder and heavier air. This is the primary cause of all move ments in the atmosphere, which, otherwise, would remain uniformly unagitated. Velocity of Winds. — Winds display an almost endless variety in then velocity and force ; from the zephyr, which scarcely stirs the leaves of the forest, to the gale, which bends its mightiest branches, and the hurricane, which tears np its trees by the roots and destroys the hab itations of man. The following table contains some results obtained by Smeaton, the celebrated engineer, respecting the force and velocity of certain kinds of winds : — Perpendicular force on one square foot, in pound. Velocity in mile, and decimal part, of a por hour. pound avoirdupois.

Use of Winds. — Winds have a purifying effect on the atmosphere : they dissipate miasma exhaled from infected districts or from stagnant water ; they waft our ships ; they transport the vapors from the sea, to moisten and fertilize the land ; and they carry the seeds of plants far and wide, and thus extend the empire of vegetation. Classes of Winds. — Winds may be divided into three classes, Con stant, Periodical, and Variab'e. Constant, or * Trade Win Ls.— These winds prevail generally in the * The term trade was use 1 in former times as synonymous with track; hence, tho winds which blow constantly in one direction are called trade winds, becange they follow \ certain track.

To Politicians wo say, remain where you are ; we have no room for you. To the industrious man we say that his removal to Texas will be a blessing. Our lands are cheap, yielding abundantly for the labor bestowed. In the upper portion of our country the climate is delightful and healthy, the water wholesome, and every means at hand adapted to his purposes. There is, besides all this, no occasion to feed our stock-cattle through the winter, and even our work-oxen can provide themselves with food and keep in good condition on the prairies nine months in the year, without being fed with a single ear of corn; and although there are many persons — I will not call them farmers — that brag they do not feed their oxen even during the remaining three months, yet such a course ought to be condemned as being improvident. With this fact every practical farmer will be soon acquainted, as they will readily find the difference when they are carrying on their spring work. Did our space permit, we might continue this article to a much greater length ; but before we conclude we must seriously advise those who own small patches of land, or are living on rented lands, to immediately prepare and remove to Texas, and at once supply themselves with comfortable homes, for we can supply hun dreds of thousands with good, rich lands. Besides, should any thing turn up that they should wish to return to their native State after two or three years' residence in Texas, they will certainly be able to realize a handsome sum for their improvements. Although in the upper portion of Texas you can scarcely find any but a healthy location, yet we would impress the following remarks upon the minds of all who may emigrate to Texas. Seek a healthy place ABOVE ALL THINGS. If you settle in timber-land, get a dry spot and let the sun shine on you : don't cut down every shade-tree, though. Keep away from marshes and ponds where the water is stagnant. The clear streams are not so unwholesome ; yet it is best not to be too near them. Do not build on a high spot amidst low lands, thinking to bo safe thus. Experience proves that in most localities throughout this country, elevated places thus sur rounded are unhealthy, — especially if on the east side of the low land ; the miasma seems to rise and hang around the hills. If you build a log house, peel the logs, hew them, and chink up snugly, raise the floor high from the ground, and thus secure warmth and dryness and avoid the dirt and dampness of unhewn logs. If a framed house, make a good cellar if possible, line with side-boards under your clap-boards, or fill in your walls with brick, — something, in short, to make your home more comfortable than the balloon houses in which so many roast in summer and freeze in winter. I have seen several gravel wall or concrete houses, built in octagon form, substantial and convenient, as well as cheap. Brick and stone can often be had.
000890301	000890301_202	MILAM COUNTY. 203 market, per acre. Yet even these advantages could not be enjoyed without alloy. From the immense amount of vegetable matter produced in this fertile valley, which was necessarily constantly decomposing, the atmosphere became charged with miasma, and much sickness ensued among the settlers. They soon found out that, however valuable these weed-prairies were for cultivation, it was almost folly for any person to attempt to build his habitation near them ; so, benefit ing by the experience they had gained, they learned to work the weed-prairies, but built their houses on the sides of the beautiful hills which surround them,— thus obtaining the advantages of pure air, uncontaminated with malaria ; and, although these prairies have been from that time to this cultivated in this rude manner, they continue to yield the same bountiful results which they did in olden times. In the month of February, 1836, a company of rangers was stationed as high up the country as the Waco Village, one of the most beautiful of the many beau tiful town-sites to be found on the Brazos; but, from the scarcity of provisions and the difficulty of conveying the small quantity of the necessaries of life, (and few indeed were they that these efficient frontier soldiers required,) they were forced to retire to the Falls; and, notwithstanding all their exertions during the months of April, May and June, innumerable were tho acts of cruelty, and immense was the depredation, committed by the savages. And, in consequence of the poverty of the Government, these rangers were disbanded, and for a time the magnifi cent region of country between the Colorado and the Brazos was deserted by the white man. But as the white man had, for a time, deserted this region of country, and as there was no further inducement for the savages to steal, they too retired to their villages on the Brazos, as they deemed themselves more secure high up tho country, where they could enjoy and revel in the fruits of their predatory excursions unmolested. In the year 1838, the Land-Office was reopened, and a change came over this por tion of the country. With the characteristic love for the acquisition of land that is so strongly developed in the American character, swarms of surveyors and locaters now filled this portion of the country, all anxious to secure the valuable lands to be found in the valleys of tho Bosque, Leon, Lampases, Salado, and other tributaries of tho Brazos ; and although they dared not venture far up the country, but were forced to confine themselves within the limits of their previous operations in 1S37, yet they acted tho part in the protection of that portion of the country that the spies and soldiers of that year filled, and acted as the pro tectors of those whose homes were then on the frontier. In the months of July, August and September, the few inhabitants who sought shelter within the forts of Tenochtitlan and Nashville were continually annoyed by the inroads made by the Indians, who, on every occasion, harassed them by stealing their horses, — but not always with impunity, for late in the month of August, the Indians having succeeded in driving off about fifteen head of the best horses in the neighborhood, a company of rangers, under Capt.

It was like the guess of another wise prognostieator, that Martin Van Buren would support Gen. Jackson after he left Mr. Crawford, and that the General would appoint him Secretary of State. These appointments grew out of the nature and fitness of things, and not out of a corrupt bargain, as calum niators charged, and yet the charge stuck to Henry Clay through his whole life and is still like a poisonous miasma hovering over his tomb. The debate had lasted days, when John C. Wright arose to reply ; he had already placed himself at the very head of the House as a cool, collected, pointed, sarcastic debater ; nothing could excite him or throw him off his balance. As he arose I observed Mr. Randolph rise and walk down the main isle toward the door. Mr. Wright, in a loud voice, " I have a word for the gentleman from Virginia, the same gentleman I now see retreating from the hall of the House." Mr. Randolph, turn ing and walking back to his seat, with his shrill voice, " I am not retreating, I am not retreating." " No, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is advancing, I hope he will remain with us, I have much to say to him to day." In the course of his remarks he was very severe, so much so at times as to bring down the hammer of the Speaker. While he was upon Mr. Randolph, Gen. Hamilton, of South Carolina, who was one of the worshipers of Mr. Randolph, sprang to his feet and at the top of his voice, under great excitement, " The most infernal tongue that was ever placed in a man's head, and wholly irresponsible ; chal lenge him, and he will swear he can't see the length of his arm." This idea grew out of the answer of Mr. Wright to the challenge of Romu lus M. Saunders — "I have received your challenge, but can not accept it ; owing to the imperfection of my vision I could not tell your honor from a sheep, ten steps." The moment Mr. Wright took his seat, George Kreemer rose, and with a voice like a newly-weaned mule colt, " The gentleman reminds me of an old hen I have at home, that is always cackling and never lays an egg." As flat as this was, there was, evidently by preconcert, a roar of laughter over the House for the moment. Mr. Wright rose in an instant. " I rise, Mr. Speaker, to a point of order. I wish to learn from the Chair whether it would be in order to read the record of an indictment for perjury which I hold in my hand, against one George Kreemer?" The Speaker, much excited — " Certainly not, certainly not." " I only asked for information, I have no disposition to violate the rules of the House." The excite ment had now become intense. The House adjourned. Mr. Wright and Mr. Vaughan, the British Minister, started down the Avenue arm

They are capable, if not of loving and hating like human beings, certainly of something of a very kindred character. I owned a riding-horse once, that I attached to my person so closely, that he would never leave me when we were from home, if he could possibly help it ; and on one occasion, the carriage in which my wife and myself were riding, broke down before, throwing us upon his heels. I spoke to him kindly, calling him by name ; he turned his head, looked directly at us, and quietly kept his place until we got out and released him — and yet, he was a horse of high mettle. May I be excused for referring to a matter that I deem sufficiently important to be noticed in this address. I allude to the kind of houses to insure health to the family. In our climate, with our luxuriant vegetable growth, the earth upon which our houses are necessarily built, becomes damp, and emits a miasma, producing our intermittent fevers, so distressing to our people. My suggestion is, that whether your house be large or small, high or low, of one or more stories, built of brick, frame or logs, raise the basement at least four feet from the ground ; and give a free, open circulation of air beneath, by windows, to be closed in cold weather. While such houses may not prove an infal lible remedy against the climate, and causes referred to, I am satisfied that they will alleviate the present distress in the fall season of the year. I should do injustice to the object of my address, were I to omit a word to the women, who are taking so much interest in the success of this association, and who form the life of our families, and give char acter to the domestic household. Much, very much of the success of the farmer, depends upon the domestic qualities of his wife, to cheer him on through life, and make his home the center of his and her happiness. This is especially true in a country like ours, where the joint labor and care of the sexes seem to be required, to insure suc cess and happiness to the family circle. When a stranger enters the dwelling of our farmers, his eye at once embraces the order of the room ; he sees whether it looks clean, and the furniture in its proper place and well dusted ; and should he be invited to a meal with the family, as of course he will be if it is meal-time, although he may not expect any thing extra, he will look for such table comforts as the farm and the garden may yield, without extra cost, to be served up in a plain, neat and clean manner. He has a right to expect good, sweet, well-worked butter, and milk, the safely cared for and kept fruits of the garden and the orchard, with the more substantial products of the barn-yard and the fields. No class of our citizens can live so well, at so little expense, as the Indiana farmer ; and none can be so entirely

XIV. — On the 19th, at nine o'clock in the morn ing, the Berthollet arrived at Varna, where the Turks had a garrison of 6,000 men. The progress of events became rapid ; there was no longer any doubt as to the intentions of the for the encampment of his troops. The camp, having its right towards the fort of Mungchie, the left towards that of the Piræus, and the front turned in the direction of Athens, was placed upon a ground of which the higher part, toward the north, protected the troops against the north west winds, which bring with them the miasma from the marshes of Athens. The ultimatum addressed to the Greek Government, was the dismissal of the Ministry, the substitution of a Cabinet friendly to the allied Powers, and a formal declaration of complete neutrality. The King signified his entire acceptance, after a conference which took place on board the flag-ship, between General Forey, Admiral Le Barbier de Tinan, and Messrs. Wyse and Forth-Rouen. It was agreed, that, in order to insure the fulfilment of the promises of the Court of Athens, a force of 3,000 men should remain at the Piræus, so as to occupy that point strongly. Colonel Breton took the command of this body. The object of the mission intrusted to General Forey being attained, by the return of the Greek Government to sentiments more worthy of itself, the General immediately gave orders that the troops, with the exception of the 3,000 men required for the occupation of the Piræus, should continue, on the 29th, their progress towards Gallipoli, where Marshal Saint- Arnaud awaited them with the utmost impatience. But the division did not arrive complete, as he had demanded it, to guard against the grave and pressing contingencies of the siege of Silistria. Before embarking, General Forey left, as ar. adieu to those who re mained, these words : — " In parting from you, I take with me, at least, as a consolation, the certainty that the corps of occupation will revive in this country, the recollections left here by the French army, in the cam paign which gave liberty to Greece, and placed her in the rank of the nations of Europe."

002643651	002643651_71	68 PERSONAL NARRATIVE. The population of this city is variously reported. The Pasha's engineer (a Levantine) fixed it to me at 100,000; but I think, general belief will not put it above 60,000. This appears very few for its magnitude; but all the native dwellings which we have seen, spread, like our own house, over a disproportionate space. We have found great inconveniences, in summer and now in winter, from this mode of building (you are so hot and so cold): yet it seems eminently conducive to the health of towns to limit the popula tion on a given area. Here it is done by hereditary custom, guiltless of theory ; and perhaps, by the still surviving influence of some ancient religion. In spite of dying cats and dogs, and refuse of various kinds, and the total absence of street-wardens, Aleppo has, on the whole, a sweet-smelling atmosphere, more like to an English country town than to a city. I can only attribute this to the thinness of population in it. EngUsh cities (and towns in progress) need a law, limiting the population on every square perch. At present we do not think of summer miasma. It is very cold : the water in our tank freezes. Since the above was written, we have received the afflicting intelhgence of the death of Mrs. P. at Ladakia. She had been somewhat shaken by a fall from her ass (a very nice animal), and a slight iUness, aggravated by very improper medicines which she fancied were good for her, ended in violent inflammation of the bowels. Alas! to possess English drugs without EngUsh physicians at hand, is a dreadful power. The brother and mother here are so deeply affected, that I ask: What does the noble hearted husband suffer, but so lately a bridegroom? I am astounded at the reverse. Two months back she was hanging over my pillow, weeping and kissing me as a dying man: now here am I in youthful vigour, and she is in the grave. * * * What a meek and quiet spirit was she, active to laboriousness, though refined in person! Affectionate she was, very dear to me also, but unspeakable is the loss to others. This is the third wife taken from those whom I desired as comrades : one died in DubUn, one in Bagdad, now one in Ladakia. F. W. N. LETTER XLIII. Aleppo, December 1831. Alas ! dear friend ! we have suffered a loss quite irreparable. * * * * No blame against Mr. P. ought to be mixed with sympathy for this melancholy event. Her brother, on medical grounds, saw no objection to the journey: and I almost think, Mr. P. in part designed change of scene for her; since a summer here must have been wearisome enough to one so cut off from intercourse with natives. She had so little talent for languages, that she scarcely even tried to talk. The outburst of sympathy for her among some of the Franks is very refreshing. The old men at least have hearts; but so have the women. None of them knew her mind, except by nods and smiles; but they saw her cheerfulness and sweetness, her constant activity in duty, and kind attentions to mother, brother, brother's child, and

" " She's dead,"— of the mahout, for " Para, para," a "hog-deer ! " On dragging her out of the odoriferous lemon-bush, she proved to be a very fine tigress, her dugs full of milk, and measuring in length 10 feet 5 inches. She had 3 shots in her; one, tbe fatal ball, in her shoulder, one in tbe thigh, and another through both houghs. Coming out of the thicket, we fell in with the surviving cub, the last scion of this ill-fated family ; and Dawkins, dismounting from his elephant, and arming himself with a kookaree or mountain-dagger, attempted to take tbe beautiful little creature alive ; but it made so furious an attack, that he was obliged to knock it on tbe bead. Having secured our game upon the elephants, we drove on to our camp at Synspore, Mr. Grey accompanying us. Our encampment occupied a beautiful site on the edge of the forest, with a green lawn in front, gently sloping down to the rushy level through which the little river mean dered. For miles in advance tbe banks of the stream are clothed with thick grass ; and the frequent patches of tall, rank rushes and reeds, with the filmy marsh miasma floating and dancing in aguish wreaths above them, wore greater charms in tbe eyes of us tiger-hunters, than would have tbe far-famed gardens of Sbalimar, or even those of royal Kensington. But, in spite of its promising qualities, and the notoriety of the spot as a tiger-haunt, our disappointment was as great as our expectations were overweening. We had no sooner arrived at Synspore than the Jemadar of the village presented himself, and, with a thousand " khodabunds ! " and " mharajs ! " besought our aid against a tiger, which, he said, bad this season killed 9 bullocks and a horse belonging to his village, and had two days ago wounded a veleitee sahib (English gentleman), doubtless Captain Kent. Making sure of our prey the next day, we deter mined to give our elephants a good rest (for they were

DELTA OF THE GANGES. 283 Hundreds of boats lay along the shore freighted with wood and grain ; many of the larger craft, fine teak-built vessels, were Birmese ; and their crews, with their coarse flat fea tures and massive muscular limbs, contrasted strongly with the light, supple, and graceful figures of the Bengalees. We afterwards met one of these huge boats coming up the river. It stood at least 10 feet out of the water, and was propelled by 40 long oars, pulled by men in a standing position. They kept time with the greatest precision, though the measure, two short strokes succeeded by two long ones, appeared rather difficult. The rowers were in full chorus as we passed them. The nameless creek on which this bazaar is established is, I should judge, at least as wide as the Thames at Windsor; and 100 such streams intersect the Great Delta of the Ganges, rendering roads almost useless. Although this portion of Bengal is so subject to inunda tions, and so replete with miasma-fostering jungles, the inhabitants did not strike me as being less healthful than their more northern brethren. Elephantiasis is indeed here more common, but this frightful disease does not disqualify the patient for bodily labour. To the mind of the traveller journeying from the north there is something remarkably pleasing in the peaceful and almost Utopian constitution of the Bengalee community, as compared with tbe more warlike character of the tribes he has just left behind. In the upper provinces, in general, the soldier is blended so intimately with the cultivator, that be who guides the plough and casts the seed wears a shield on his shoulder, and at his side a sword which he may have to wield in defence of his harvest. War mixes not with the dreams, nor weapons with the dress, of tbe purely pastoral Bengalee. He is placid, contented, and unambitious — apathetic and selfish if you please — and must truly and gratefully appreciate that change of go vernment which allows him to eat his bread and worship his gods without fear of invasion from Mussulman or Mahratta, or the rapacity of those predatory hordes whom

The settlement can never be without it. When comfortable habitations are built, a foreigner would endanger his health by a residence here no more than spending the same time in sailing down the coast." ..." Could a person from America spend one week of the rainy season on this coast, on board a ship or on shore, he would find no difficulty as to the great cause of fever to new comers. In other parts of Africa it may be different; but on Mesurado, the cause of sickness is not marsh miasma, nor exhalations from the earth, nor the influence of the sun, but an atmosphere loaded with oceans of vapour. For months, this humid quality of the air receives not the least correction or abatement, day or night. Contrary to all former prejudices, I have indulged daily in the use of spirits, wine, and bark, for the purpose of giving tone to the system, and bracing it against the relaxing influence of a soaked and watery atmosphere, and have found benefit from the practice, I will say of Mesurado, that no situation in West Africa is more healthy. " The sea air does all for it that can be done in this climate. One peculiarity is, that the night air is nearly as pure as any other. The severs with which our company have been visited, are all nearly of the same type; quotidian and tertian inter mittent, rather of the putrescent than inflammatory character — commonly gentle in degree, and easily subdued by remedies. Such has been the character of the sickness so far. The vio lent symptoms of the Sherbro fever have not manifested them selves in a single instance. "The rapidity and luxuriance of vegetation here, can scarcely be imagined by natives of temperate latitudes. A crop of beans now on the ground, grows without supporters, three and a half feet high. The pods on an average are eleven inches long. The seed was brought from America. I now find great ad vantage in having been bred a farmer. When the cape is a little more cleared away; and dry, airy, and substantial dwel lings built, I do not conceive it a matter of the greatest impor tance to the health of the settlers, at what season they land here. The commencement of the rains would be the least favourable, but of any other season, there is little to choose. The constitution will be tried by the climate, arrive when they may."

Through this hot and oppressive valley a mere thread of a rivulet meanders sluggishly from the base of Connor's Hill to the beach near the Cape. On its banks a thin greenish scum rests, slightly covering the earth. In front of my house, close by the stream, is a grove of palm-trees. Under the cool damp shade the humid atmosphere has begotten the malarious fungi which cover the soil, as with a green veil. A little to the left of the palm grove, not a hundred yards from my house, there is a deep excavation, about thirty feet in diameter, and lower than the little rivulet flowing by its mouth. The excavation has drained itself full of water ; the surface of the excavation, now a pond, is covered over with weeds and plants. Out of this pond, the sluggish little stream and the slime under the palm grove, is exhaled every evening and throughout the night the miasma which causes so much misery in Cape Coast. What follows ? What followed with me after coming to live in the neighbourhood answers the question. On the second day I was ill with fever ; on the third day my servant had an attack ; on the fourth my native cook came to me, with swim ming eyes and throbbing forehead, to ask for medicine. The fever was defeated again, and left us all with only its bitter memories ; with abated energies and strength ; with frames susceptible to a new attack of the disease, when it has once more gathered force sufficient to be aggressive. When I summon resolution to leave the fetid valley for the heights, crowned by the Government offices, my lungs inhale new life from the pure sea breezes which are constantly being wafted ashore from the wide Western Ocean, and a spasmodic energy is felt for a time, until the stagnant vapours of the valley, where I live, shall sap and destroy it again, and lay me once more prostrate. In addition to this valley, with its filth, which poisons the whole of Cape Coast, the late rains have demolished over 300 mud-built houses, which crushed to death, as they fell on the

The truth ofthe old adage that " to be forewarned is to he half armed " has received a total denial, for long before the spring tides commenced a prophecy was made concerning the overflow of the Thames, but little or no heed or precaution was taken should such be the case, which actually occurred on the 20th ofthe month, the river rising to a height not attained for for the past .10 years, many ofthe low lying streets on the south side ofthe river becoming a prey to the devastating influence of " Thames mud " and nearly 300 persons, mostly of the poorer class, sufferers thereby ; nor can it be a cause of wonder when we remember that the Thames Embankment, on the north side, has reclaimed in some places over 80ft. of the original bed, thereby causing an increased rise on the opposite side, where, meeting with no impediment, it took the liberty of entering the dwellings of the people, and removing many of their portable goods to other parts. Let us hope that as " experience bought is better than taught " some steps will be taken to prevent a recurrence ofthe same in the future.

This process really seems to have been resorted to in the case of the Ashantee War, for while Sir Garnet has not been dubbed with empty honours only, but one in the tangible torm of £2.500 as well as grand banquets. &c, the poor soldiers on landing at Portsmouth were regaled with a feast of hread-and-cheese and beer, and the empty commendation of •' well done."

In the month of April was received the melancholy news of the death [May 3, 1873] of that world-famed traveller Dr. Livingstone,0 who, after spending years of arduous toil in the interests of science, the good of his fellow men, and the advancement of commerce, fell a victim to the destroying influences of miasma and privation in the African wilds. It has been said of old " a prophet is not honoured iu his own country," and surely this was the case with Livingstone ; for months no tidings could be gleaned of his whereabouts, and rumours were current that he had perished by thc natives' hand, yet, with all his self-denial for his country's good, was the appeal to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for assistance to fit out an expedition of discovery made in vain, and he was allowed to remain uucared for and unsought till the better feelings of Mr. Stanley (an American) led him to do for a stranger that which was refused by his own countrymen. On the loth, the last remains ofthe Dr. were landed at Southampton, when a grand procession was formed to convey them to the Railway Terminus prior to their removal to London for interment in Westminster Abbey with great solemnity (Her Majesty having kindly sent a large bouquet of flowers to place on the coffin). Great meetings were held in various parts of England aud Scotland in praise of Livingstone, and to make arrangements for the speedy erection ofa statue. Why all this fuss over a dead man, when while living even necessaries were refused him ? Does not this look very much like asking for bread and receiving a stone V " Welcome as the flowers in May" was the presence of His Majesty the Czar of Russia on the shores of England on the 13th of the month.** By one of those accidents which will happen in the best arrangements, even though royalty is concerned, the august visitor was compelled to land at Dover instead of Gravesend as origanally intended.

It is evident, therefore, why this remedy, when used in malarious fevers, acts so beneficially. By its contraction, or process of withering, it destroys the fast growth of the poisonous fungoids in the system, and, if there is no complication, eradi cates the disease. This fever is only contagious under certain circumstances. Knowing how it is germinated, it will be readily perceived that when a person is attacked with it, in damp unventilated places, it follows as a matter of course, that from the moment the spores in or on the patient become free, all the inmates of the same place, and especially when they are crowded together and filthy in their habits, will be subjected to the disease ; and in so far only is it communicable. Since writing the above, I met with an interesting article on ' The Causes of Ague,' and as it bore so forcibly on what I had written, I transcribe some of its paragraphs at length. 'The fertile source of desolation and disease consists of in calculable myriads of microscopic cells, suspended in the at mosphere over waste, marshy, and fen districts. They are minute oblong cells, single or aggregate, and having a distinct nucleus, with a clear interspace, apparently empty, between it and the cell wall. They are of the algoid type, strongly re sembling the Palmella, and are consequently amongst the very lowest organisms known. Sometimes several of these cells or spores are contained in an outer cell or wall, or delicate in vesting membrane, to form a plant. ' Of these " ague plants " is formed the greyish film where ever damp, black earth is turned up and exposed to the sun. These spores or minute seeds (germinating cells) rise into the air, carrying pestilence with them.1 There are several species of the " ague plant," which have been called Gemiasma, from the Greek for earth, and the word miasma. The white, and a yellowish green variety, occur usually in a non-calcareous soil, and produce agues of but slight intensity, and are the only ones known in England. There are also red, green, and lead- 1 These spores may be found, I believe, in the expectoration of people seized with ague.

I will begin with the very focus of malaria, Port Louis, and mention a few of the numerous causes of infection in that city alone. The foul streams flowing through it in all directions are, two thirds of the year, almost stagnant ; the other third they are swollen by the torrential rains, and bear along masses of vege table and animal matter from the hills and Indian camps, which, as the waters subside, lie festering in the sun, poisoning the atmosphere. The emanations from the open drains, the imperfect drainage of the houses, and the defective method of disinfecting the night-soil, load the air with mephitic vapours. The gradually filling-up of the east end of the harbour, from the mud constantly pouring into it, and the tide not being strong enough to wash away the impurities that lodge in the muddy bottom, adds its quota to the malaria. The low shores to the west of the city are only covered at high tides, and are strewn with decayed sea-weed and filth, washed in from the shipping. Between Port Louis and Fort William lies a swamp, that receives into its rank vegetation the streams that flow from the cemeteries and another swampy land at the back of them. These cemeteries contain in themselves a very sufficient cause of malaria. The emanations from them are at times most deadly, owing to the circumstances that the dead are not interred deeply enough, and the loose earth and coral which cover them permit the escape of the gases evolved by their decompo sition. It has been frequently remarked that the health of the city has invariably suffered when the miasma from its western side has been blown over it. Between Port Louis and Grand River are low lands, prolific in the germs of malaria. After heavy rain the Grand River swells, and receives into its floods filth of every kind, which is swept down, or deposited all over its course, or left in pools to decompose in the sun. Near its entrance to the sea, where the waste water spreads out over the wide embouchure made by the torrents of ages.

" St. Augustin is too wann in summer, and too damp through out the year; and, as before indicated, the combination of heat and moisture produces malaria, AA-ith ad its attendant and ever ready agents, to conspire against health and life. St. Paul is too cold in winter, and too moist the year round. At Mentone, Dr. Bennett, who is recognized as the chief authority in favor of that place, tells his British patients they should return home at the close of autumn. At Funchal, the atmosphere is wet to saturation; but as the climate is very equable — as a place to die at, perhaps it is as good .as any to those who stand by the for lorn hope. " Of paramount concern to the immigrant, is the healthfulness of the place which is to be the locality of his future labors and the home for himself and family.

Thousands of immigrants from the New England States, from Germany and L-eland, and Scandinavia, and, in fact, ad the nationalities of Europe have been induced by the American Railroad subsidized (land) companies, to seek homes in the north-west, along the line of road, in Indiana, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, etc. These corporations sow their pamphlets, translated in the various languages, broadcast over the United States and Europe.

The territory along the Rock Island road beyond Englewood (to which point the city settlement has become nearly continuous,) is well adapted to occupation, and is rapidly settling up. Blue Island is the present limit of suburban enterprise, and Washington Heights, situated on a plateau some 125 feet above the level of the lake, may be called the nucleus. The west part of the town of Lake and the east part of the town of Worth have not been much sought after previous to the season of 1873 ; but they afford many eligible sites for suburban villages. Aside from the district mentioned, the town of Worth, like that of Palos and Lyons, with the exception about to be noted, are rather unattract ive; much of the land being low and difficult of drainage. Border ing on the Desplaines river in the town of Lyons, however, is a strip of country well elevated, picturesque and not open to the objection of miasma, which has been raised against the Desplaines country further up and abreast of the city. The town of Cicero is mostly well elevated prairie, draining easily into the South Branch. The country to the west of Cicero, on the Northwestern and Burlington railways, lies high and well ; that on the latter road, just west of Hinsdale, reaching the highest altitude between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi. About the same altitude is claimed for points on the Chicago & Pacific road, however; the altitude at Roselle, 24 miles out, being set down at 191 feet, and that of Ontario, 27^ miles out, at 231 feet. The surface all along the C. & P. road, west of the city limits, is high and rolling. Along the Chicago and St. Paul road, and the Wisconsin division of the Northwestern road, the topography is in every way favorable to rapid settlement, being, for the most part, a beautiful, high rolling prairie, abounding in fine farms, broken only by the frequent sub urban villages which already dot the country with neat villages along the latter line. Passing around farther eastward, the prairie first becomes flatter and lower, and then gives way to the sandy but by no means sterile ridge which skirts Lake Michigan from the city northward far past the limits of Cook County. The shore at Evanston becomes deci dedly high and abrupt, furnishing picturesque sites for villas, ren dered all the more so by the sharp ravines by which the shore is cut.

In Fig. 49, on the next page, are de lineated the features of a Russian North-Sea pilot. Among them are distinguished the Ostiaks, the Vogouls, the Finns of Siberia, the Finns of Eastern Russia, and the Finns of the Baltic. The Finns of Siberia form two groups ; one in the south, the other in the north. The former is composed of certain people known under the names of the Teleouts, Sagai's, and Kachintz, whose language bears some general affinity to Turkish dialects. These give themselves up to hunting, fishing, and agriculture, and are subject to the Russian Empire. The northern group is formed of two people, the Ostiaks and the Vogouls, who have retained Finnish dialects. The Vogouls form only a very insignificant population dwelling east of the Oural, and have undergone such mixture with the Turks and Mongolians as to have adopted to a great extent their characteristics. The Ostiaks who dwell upon the banks of the Obi appear to have preserved in much greater perfection the characteristics of the Finns. They are a people devoted to hunting and fishing, with red hair, very uncivilised, and partly idolatrous. Madame Eva Felinska, during an exile in Siberia, inspected, as far as possible, the Ostiak huts. These habitations were so foul, and gave forth such putrid miasmas, that, notwithstanding her curiosity, this lady w-as unable to remain in them more than a minute. The Ostiaks cover their skins with a layer of rancid fat, over which they wear a reindeer skin. They eat uncooked fish or game, this being their ordinary food. But from time to time they go with large buckets of bark to Berezer, where they collect, and devour as delicacies, the refuse of the kitchens. Fig. 50 (p. 143) represents an Ostiak hut. The Finns of Eastern Russia comprise the Baskirs, the Teptiars, and the Metscheriaks of the Southern Oural : three small peoples who speak Turkish dialects mingled with Finnish words, and who exist in very much the same way. The Baskirs are the most numerous ; they are engaged in rearing horses and bees. Like the Cossacks, they furnish bodies of cavalry to the Russian army.

Decatur county is bounded on the north by Benton county, on the south by the Tennessee River and Hardin county, on the east by the counties of Henderson and Carroll, and on the west by the Tennessee River. This county contains about 550 square miles. The number of acres returned for taxation, exclusive of town lots, is 322,690, valued at $3,214,148, or nearly ten dollars per acre. Divisions. There are twelve civil districts and twelve school districts in the county, which comprise all the artifical divisions in the eountv. The natural divisions are those which are created by the various creeks or rivers. It might also be mentioned that there is a ridge, known in the county as the " shore line," which traverses the county in a north and south direction, and forms two divisions known locally as the " sand district" and the " rocky district," the former being west of the ridge and the latter being east of it. History. Decatur county was formerly a part of Perry county, but in November, 1845, the General Assembly of the State passed an act, which went into effect on the first Monday in April, 1846, dividing Perry into two counties, giving to that of the old county lying west of the Tennessee River the name of " Decatur county, in honor of and to perpetuate the memory of Commodore Decatur of the United States Navy, of whose services our nation should be proud and whose mem ory should be revered." Health Statistics. The people of Decatur county claim to have one of the healthiest counties in West Tennessee, and with the exception of a few neighborhoods, this claim is not without foundation. In those sections of the county which are subject to be annually overflowed by the Tennessee River, and even in the immediate vicinity of these sec- tions there is more than a usual amount of sickness growing out of the superabundance of miasmas which rise from the overflowed terri- tory. But with these exceptions, the county is generally healthy, the prevailing diseases in summer being of the malarial type, and in the winter, affection of the lungs. The mortuary list of the county will compare very favorably with that of the other river counties in West Tennessee.

By means of the Nasmyth steam hammer, some of the heaviest shafts and cranks in existence have been forged at this establishment. As an evidence of the remuneration which skill of a special order will command, it is worthy of mention that in some evi dence given by Colonel Clay, the then manager of this concern, before a Committee of the House of Commons, it was stated that two of the workmen employed in connection with the great forge hammer were paid at the rate of £20 per week each. AAThen Mr. Cuthbert Bisbrown laid out the new town of Harrington about 1775, it was proposed to establish a direct ferry communication with the opposite shore of Cheshire. A ferry station was made on the shore and a lofty house built for a tavern. This stood near the line of the present Sefton Street, nearly opposite the Harrington Dock, and being a conspicuous and isolated object, was long known by the name of the " Tall House." The scheme of the ferry was before its time, and it soon had to be abandoned. The buUding was used at one time as a ladies' school, subsequently as a tavern, and was finally taken down about 1844. The ferry station has been revived within the last few years, and a landing-stage has been con structed not far from the site of the Tall House, where the steamboats for New Ferry call on their passage up and down. The streets running east and west between Park Road and Sefton Street are wide and open, but have nothing remarkable in their character. The gradient is somewhat steep, rising about 90 feet in 700 yards, or 1 in 23. In a sanitary point of view, these circumstances are favourable, the west winds from the river having a clear course to sweep away the miasma generated in the close confined courts and alleys with which the interiors of the blocks are filled. A few public buildings in this quarter may here be noticed. The Church of Holy Trinity, south side of Parliament Street, was built in 1858 with schools behind in Ashwell Street. The front is plain brick, hemmed in between the houses. H.ard by, in Beaufort Street, is an institution called the Domestic Mission, having schools, ancl a room for meetings and lectures. A AVelsh Baptist Chapel was erected on the north side of Stanhope Street in 1834, taken down in 1870 for the purposes of the RaUway Tunnel. The Church of St. Matthew, Hill Street, was built in 1848-9, the first stone having been laid by the Earl of Sefton,

A plentiful supply of pure water is derived from the spurs of the Zuurberg close to the town, whence the Kowie springs issue, which, stored up in three reservoirs, holding 24,000,000 of gallons, is distributed over the streets through twelve miles of iron mains, supplying 600 service pipes or private leadings. In addition there are several public dams, private tanks, and a copious well-supply available in the lower parts of the city, where the rainfall per colating through the gravel to the retentive clay beneath is dammed up by the trap-rock of the valley. The natural facilities for drainage, lateral gullies, gravelly subsoil, and the steep incline of the valley and consequent absence of swampy ground effectually prevent miasma, and the sewage is nightly removed two miles to the leeward, and deodorised in pits with alternate layers of earth. Hence there are no endemic diseases, no fevers, save an occasional sporadic case from the neglect of the ordinary f anitory rules, none in fact but preventible causes of disease. The military statistics prove it to be one of the healthiest stations of the British army ; and the civil hospital returns give incontrovertible evidence of the same facts. Elevated a third of a mile (1,760 feet) above the sea, and distant from it about twenty-five miles in a direct line, the ozone-laden breeze from the coast reaches the mountain-top daily about three p.m., flowing imperceptibly over the Graham's Town valley. At one spot (called from the circumstance " Waai Neck "), at the top of the Howison's Poort, a perfect syphon-system of ventilation, a diurnal in draught from the sea is thus carried on in the calmest weather, the heated air rising from the plains below through the Poort over Goodwin's Kloof, the wooded seaward slopes of the mountain cooling it before it reaches the city. Thus the climate of Graham's Town is cooler, drier, aud more temperate than that of

It cannot be doubted that Sexual Selection has been an agent in producing the physical differences which exist between the sexes, and also between the races of mankind. As Mr. Darwin has shown, the women in savage tribes exercise a greater power of choice than is commonly supposed ; but even if they exercised none, it would not affect his argument, for the strongest, bravest, and most intelligent (or wealthiest) men obtain most wives and raise most children, and these men undoubtedly select. But I do not think that sexual selection (as Mr. Darwin believes) has caused the jet blackness of the negro, which I would rather attribute to conditions of climate acting indirectly on the skin. Comeliness of feature proceeds, no doubt, from sexual selection, and in all African tribes we find the patricians more handsome than the slaves and lower classes. If blackness proceeded from sexual selection we should find the nobles darker than the people ; but that is not the case. Mr. Darwin's first supposition was this, that ' negroes and other dark races might have acquired their dark tints by the darker indi viduals escaping, during a long series of generations, from the deadly influence of the miasmas of their native countries,' and he afterwards found out the same idea had long ago occurred to Dr. Wells (a pape* read before the Royal Society in 1813). Mr. Darwin abandoned this hypothesis, because the evidence that he collected forced him to suppose that light-coloured Europeans do not escape from fever better than the dark ones. But Mr. Heddle, of Sierra Leone, who has spent his life on the Coast, and has had more clerks killed under him than any other man, holds the oppo site view ; and Captain Burton, to whom I spoke on the matter, said it was always a matter of surprise in India when alight-haired man took his pension. The fact is, that sufficient evidence cannot at present be obtained to settle the question one way or the other; and in the meantime I think that the hypothesis of Dr. Wells is the best that has been offered. In Africa some tribes are black, and some are much lighter coloured. My experience accords with that of Dr. Livingstone,

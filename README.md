# 19th Century British Fiction-Nonfiction : Knowledge Transfer & Cultural Analytics for Good

This study proposes a framework for cross-genre knowledge transfer in historical information retrieval, using the British Library 19th-century digital collection as a benchmark to examine links between fiction and non-fiction retrieval. 

## Collection
- We analyze `two distinct subsets` of the BL19 collection, classified according to the metadata provided by the British Library.
- The first subset consists of `10,210` English language works of fiction, published between `1830` and `1899`.
- The second subset comprises `15,780` English language non-fiction books from the same period.

- **Lucene Index** : The [Lucene (version 5)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_H8Uc5qwqNkpcnrJizsRBRE2Taz2w0UY?usp=drive_link) index of the metadata can be accessed here.
  
## Topics
- The selection of topics followed a structured, expert-informed process to ensure domain relevance and diversity.
- Experts proposed candidate topics based on their knowledge of genres, historical issues, and key debates.
- Through iterative consultation, `35` potential [queries]( were finalized, representing a balanced mix of fictional and non-fictional contexts. 
- Considering common searching patterns in both scholarly and public search behavior, we kept the queries intentionally with an average query length of `2.8`.

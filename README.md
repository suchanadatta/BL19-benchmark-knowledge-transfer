# 19th Century British Fiction-Nonfiction : Knowledge Transfer & Cultural Analytics for Good

This study proposes a framework for cross-genre knowledge transfer in historical information retrieval, using the British Library 19th-century digital collection as a benchmark to examine links between fiction and non-fiction retrieval. 

## Collection
- We analyze `two distinct subsets` of the BL19 collection, classified according to the metadata provided by the British Library.
- The first subset consists of `10,210` English language works of fiction, published between `1830` and `1899`.
- The second subset comprises `15,780` English language non-fiction books from the same period.

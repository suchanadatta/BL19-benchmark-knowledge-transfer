1	Italian white mice	find instances of young street performers who were trafficked from Italy, mostly to London. They are exploited by a group of 'Padroni', and earn their keep by training white mice to perform.
2	Italian Count	find examples of Italian Counts that are often portrayed as destitute, charming, and conniving. In the fiction, these Counts prey on English heiresses or aristocrats. 
3	Poor Bridget	find a series of Irish servants named Bridget who work in English homes
4	Dublin ghost banshee	This search term is rather oblique. I used this to try and locate ghost stories set in Dublin; I was successful in finding some by Elizabeth Owens Blackburne.
5	Irish Christmas Ghost (or spectre)	locate ghost stories set near Christmastime in or around Ireland
6	Irish land league	this was a 19th century group of Irish tenant famers who organised to try and gain control over the lands that they worked on.
7	Young Italy/Giovane Italia	this was a revolutionary movement which formed in Italy in the first half of the 19th century and worked towards Italian independence.
8	Women reading romance unhappy marriages foreigners/bigamists	This is a very broad one which is usually associated with the early 19th century (lots of worry about girls picking up romantic notions from fiction and eloping), but which I think may persist much later in both certain fictional narratives and in broader discourse about women, education and pasttimes. 
9	Dracula and Transylvania	find connections between these terms to understand what information was available between 1850 and 1905. (In hindsight I should have clarified that I am not interested in Bram Stoker's fictional character, but rather in the historical person who inspired the novel. That is why the reviews of the novel are not relevant in this context.)
10	East London and Jewish/Jew	any associations between 1880 and 1905 of these terms would be interesting to me, especially if they have positive connotations since the expectation is to find overwhelmingly racist, xenophobic representations.
11	Irish and London	Any results that connect the two terms would be relevant, especially if they are positive. Again, the expectation is that the majority of the depictions would be very negative.
12	Vampire and migrant	Both fiction and non-fiction results would be relevant as long as they date from before 1905.
13	Eastern and migrant	all the associations between these terms as a way to understand how migrants from this region were depicted in the late 19th c. How do these results compare to "Eastern and Jewish" query? Do they overlap?
14	Italian criminal secret society	I want to see if this association emerges alongside the emergence of the crime genre, so would be interesting to see if there is a development over time. It is generally considered that the genre is embryonic 1840s-late 1880s, then matures with publication of Sherlock Holmes stories from 1887 onwards. In the non-fiction, it would be interesting to see if this topic occurs and if it changes in character, from the period 1840-late 1870s, when there seems to have been a lot of sympathy for Italians as political refugees to the period 1870-1900 and after, when there are more of them.
15	Angel of the house and gold fields	I want to see if British literary trope of the Victorian "Angel in the house" also becomes an Australian one in mining-based fiction for children published between 1842-1910.
16	Women and wine	In 19th-century British fictions, the pairing of women and wine is more prominent in relation to male hedonism and doesn't always have a negative connotaiton. Johann Strauss's 'Wine, Women and Song' waltz, for example, was hugely popular. It is also important to realise that wine had much more positive associations than gin, for example. Offering a glass of wine as a restorative was considered an appropriate response to a young lady appearing faint, especially if combined with cake or a biscuit. Most of the negative presentations of women and alcohol feature gin (for the lower orders) and brandy (for the gentry). The gin soaked nurse is a stock figure in Dickens, for example. I think the last sentence applies much more accurately to gin.
17	Carnival and drunk	In 19th-century British fictions, the pairing of “carnival and drunk” evoked a world of excess where social hierarchies dissolved in laughter, disguise, and intoxication. Carnival scenes, charged with drunken revelry, allowed authors to explore the thin line between festivity and disorder, often casting Ireland or provincial towns as stages for such unruly spectacles. Within the Library’s holdings, the motif works as both comic release and moral warning, reflecting anxieties about class, nation, and the perils of unchecked indulgence.
18	industrial smoke	In 19th-century British fictions, “industrial smoke” became a powerful symbol of both progress and peril, darkening cityscapes while signaling the might of industry. Novelists used the imagery of chimneys and smog to frame stories of class struggle, environmental decay, and the alienation of urban life. Within the Library’s holdings, the motif often serves as a narrative shorthand for the costs of industrial modernity, casting smoke as both the breath of prosperity and the shadow of social unrest.
19	factory girls	In 19th-century British fictions, “factory girls” were frequently portrayed at the intersection of labor, morality, and vulnerability. Novelists depicted their lives amid the din of machinery to explore themes of exploitation, virtue under pressure, and the possibilities of independence within industrial society. In the Library’s holdings, these characters became symbolic figures through which broader anxieties about class, gender, and the human cost of progress were dramatized.
20	railway journeys	In 19th-century British fictions, “railway journeys” often embodied the thrill and unease of modern mobility, transforming travel into both adventure and social experiment. Novelists used trains and stations as settings where strangers met, secrets unfolded, and class boundaries blurred within the confined space of the carriage. Within the Library’s holdings, railway journeys become narrative engines of speed and suspense, symbolizing the disruptive energy of industrial progress.
21	poverty and parish	In 19th-century British fictions, “poverty and parish” often framed the struggles of the rural and urban poor within the moral and institutional structures of the parish system. Novelists depicted charity, poor relief, and parish oversight as sites of both compassion and tension, where dignity and dependence were in constant negotiation. Within the Library’s holdings, this theme becomes a narrative lens for exploring class inequality, community responsibility, and the contested meaning of social welfare in Victorian life.
22	workhouse children	In 19th-century British fictions, “workhouse children” were often portrayed as emblematic victims of poverty, embodying both innocence and the harshness of institutional life. Novelists used their experiences of hunger, discipline, and abandonment to critique social systems while also stirring readers’ sympathy and moral reflection. Within the Library’s holdings, these figures become central to narratives that expose the human cost of the Poor Law and the fragility of childhood under Victorian welfare structures.
23	empire and exile	In 19th-century British fictions, “empire and exile” often intertwined to dramatize the costs of colonial expansion, where characters found themselves displaced across distant frontiers. Novelists used tales of banishment, forced migration, or voluntary departure to explore themes of loyalty, loss, and cultural dislocation. Within the Library’s holdings, the pairing becomes a narrative device that reveals how the promise of empire was shadowed by exile, turning personal displacements into symbols of imperial consequence.
24	colonial encounters	In 19th-century British fictions, “colonial encounters” were often staged as moments of drama and discovery, where cultural difference was both exoticized and problematized. Novelists depicted meetings between colonizers and colonized as sites of tension, romance, or conflict, reflecting contemporary debates about race, power, and empire. Within the Library’s holdings, these encounters serve as narrative crucibles through which the complexities of imperial ambition and moral uncertainty were vividly explored.
25	gentlemen and gamblers	In 19th-century British fictions, “gentlemen and gamblers” were frequently paired to expose the thin boundary between refinement and vice. Novelists set scenes in clubs, gaming houses, and drawing rooms where wagers tested honor, fortune, and morality, often revealing the hidden corruption beneath genteel surfaces. Within the Library’s holdings, this motif becomes a dramatic lens on class, temptation, and the precarious balance between respectability and ruin.
26	women and education	In 19th-century British fictions, “women and education” often appeared as a site of aspiration, constraint, and social negotiation. Novelists depicted girls and young women pursuing knowledge within schools, homes, or informal settings, highlighting tensions between intellectual ambition and prescribed gender roles. Within the Library’s holdings, the theme becomes a narrative vehicle to explore the possibilities and limits of female agency, morality, and social mobility in Victorian society.
27	marriage market	In 19th-century British fictions, the “marriage market” often served as a lens for examining social ambition, economic calculation, and romantic desire. Novelists depicted drawing rooms, balls, and country estates as arenas where family interests, wealth, and social status shaped the prospects of young women and men. Within the Library’s holdings, the motif becomes a narrative device that dramatizes the interplay of love, strategy, and societal expectation in Victorian life.
28	domestic violence	In 19th-century British fictions, “domestic violence” was often portrayed as a hidden but pervasive threat within the home, revealing the vulnerabilities of women and children under patriarchal authority. Novelists depicted scenes of abuse, control, and resistance to examine moral, legal, and social tensions surrounding family life. Within the Library’s holdings, the theme becomes a narrative tool to critique domestic power, expose social injustice, and explore the limits of protection and reform in Victorian society.
29	inheritance disputes	In 19th-century British fictions, “inheritance and disputes” frequently drove plotlines of tension, intrigue, and family conflict. Novelists depicted contested wills, rival heirs, and secret claims as catalysts for suspense, moral questioning, and social commentary. Within the Library’s holdings, these narratives use inheritance as a lens to explore ambition, justice, and the fragile bonds of kinship in Victorian society.
30	slavery and freedom	In 19th-century British fictions, “slavery and freedom” often formed the emotional and moral core of narratives set in colonial contexts, dramatizing the human stakes of bondage and liberation. Novelists depicted enslaved individuals’ struggles, acts of resistance, and quests for autonomy to explore themes of justice, morality, and empire. Within the Library’s holdings, these stories transform slavery into both a personal and political drama, highlighting the costs of oppression and the possibilities of emancipation.
31	Chartist crowds	In 19th-century British fictions, “Chartist crowds” were often depicted as turbulent and charged gatherings, embodying the anxieties and hopes of a restless working class. Novelists used scenes of meetings, marches, and demonstrations to dramatize the tensions between authority and popular protest, order and disorder. Within the Library’s holdings, Chartist crowds become a narrative device for exploring social unrest, political aspiration, and the moral and emotional stakes of reform in Victorian Britain.
32	Irish famine	In 19th-century British fictions, “Irish feminine” often appeared as a constructed figure embodying both charm and perceived vulnerability, reflecting British cultural anxieties about Ireland and gender. Novelists depicted Irish women in rural and domestic settings, balancing depictions of moral virtue, passion, and resilience against stereotypes of backwardness or exoticism. Within the Library’s holdings, the motif becomes a lens through which authors explored national identity, gendered expectations, and the intersections of colonial imagination and domestic life.
33	London fog	In 19th-century British fictions, “London fog” often serves as a symbol of mystery, danger, and urban transformation, shrouding the city in both literal and moral obscurity. Novelists used foggy streets and gaslit alleys to heighten suspense, conceal secrets, and reflect the social anxieties of industrialization and overcrowding. Within the Library’s holdings, London fog becomes a narrative device that intertwines atmosphere with character, plot, and the ethical complexities of metropolitan life.
34	spiritualism and séances	In 19th-century British fictions, “spiritualism and séances” often appeared as dramatic sites where curiosity, fear, and moral reflection intersected. Novelists depicted séances and spirit communications to explore themes of grief, deception, and the boundaries between the natural and supernatural. Within the Library’s holdings, these narratives use spiritualist practices as a lens to examine human desire for connection, the unknown, and the anxieties of a rapidly changing Victorian world.
35	fallen women	In 19th-century British fictions, “fallen women” were often portrayed as figures of moral caution, embodying the social and personal consequences of transgressing gender norms. Novelists depicted their struggles with shame, redemption, or social exile to explore themes of virtue, hypocrisy, and the rigid expectations of Victorian society. Within the Library’s holdings, these characters become narrative instruments for examining morality, gender, and the fragile position of women in a judgmental social order.
